title: Is there a way to view the cards I have failed the most times on Anki?

You can list them in the Anki Browser.
For example,
to see cards that have lapsed more than 5 times
open the Anki Browser (shortcut: `b`) and type `prop:lapses>5`.
Likewise, `prop:lapses>10` will show cards that have lapsed more than 10 times, etc.

I recommend [resetting leeches](useful-anki-add-ons-for-japanese.html#reset-card-scheduling).
The extra time required to drill them in is not worth it.
After resetting
edit the corresponding notes to make them simpler and avoid lapses in the future.
For example, change the example sentence.
Afterwards relearn the updated cards.
