I never play video games.
Personally, I don't find them interesting or engaging.

I used to play video games as a teenager,
but after I grew frustrated with Windows and proprietary software,
and after switching to GNU+Linux,
I stopped playing video games.
Another reason I don't play video games anymore is because most games are proprietary.
I refuse to run proprietary software.

From the efficiency standpoint most video games are low quality immersion.
If you read a book or listen to a podcast,
you're getting immersion all the time,
but in games you get to interact with language only once in a while.
Most of the playtime is action.
However, visual novels are the opposite.
They are very close to books, with some pictures here and there.
The problem with most visual novels and games in general is that they're proprietary.
You can't play them and keep your freedom.
Another point is that
video games are bad for immersion because they're hard to mine from.
There are hardly any tools that can automate the process of extracting text, pictures and audio.
