I watch anime almost every day.

Watching anime is a good way to learn Japanese.
Most people already like it,
it's easily available,
and you can watch it with Japanese subtitles if you don't understand something.
And if you watch ongoings,
they keep you in the loop because every week you have to show up for the next episode,
so you don't lose your momentum or motivation.
