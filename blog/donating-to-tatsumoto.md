# Donating to Tatsumoto

Because almost all my content is offered free of charge,
this site and the
[Ajatt-Tools](https://github.com/Ajatt-Tools)
project relies on donations and support from its community to stay alive.
We do not have ads or privacy-violating trackers, we are entirely dependent on you.

If this site, our community or my free software projects were useful to you,
I'll appreciate if you donate to help me support myself
and continue delivering new guides, tools and resources.
You can support me over at one of the membership platforms or donate cryptocurrency.

## Liberapay
