# Donating to Tatsumoto

Because almost all my content and the tools I make are offered free of charge
the Ajatt-Tools project relies on donations to stay alive.
We do not have ads or privacy-violating trackers, we are entirely dependent on you.

If this site or our free software projects were useful to you,
I'll appreciate if you donate to the Ajatt-Tools maintenance fund
to help me support myself and continue working on Ajatt-Tools.

## Monero

Monero is considered a privacy-focused cryptocurrency, the transactions are all hidden.
There are many ways you can buy or sell Monero, one of the simplest ones is through
[ChangeNow.io](https://changenow.io/).
