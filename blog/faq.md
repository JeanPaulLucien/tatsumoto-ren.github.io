### How to learn Japanese?

You learn Japanese by self-study through immersion.
Our [guide](table-of-contents.html) contains everything you need.

### What's fluency?

Fluency is when you understand at least 98% of your immersion.

For example, a typical episode of anime contains 300-400 lines of dialog.
If you watch the episode and encounter only 7-8 or less unknown words,
you can call yourself fluent.

### Should I read the AJATT site?

Only the [Table of Contents](http://ajatt.com/toc).
Everything else isn't worth your time
unless you're really passionate about becoming a scholar of AJATT.

### Should I watch anime with English subtitles?

Yes, if you want to learn English.

This is actually how I learned English as a teenager, not even joking.
I was so fed up with the quality of subtitles in my native language
that one day I just decided to switch and start watching anime with English subs.
It was insanely hard at first and I would spend hours looking up every word in a dictionary.
However, after a few months I only had to look up a couple words here and there.

If you are serious about learning Japanese, don't use English subtitles.
Watch with Japanese subtitles or without any subtitles at all.

### Pausing. How often should I look things up?

If you never pause it means you don't look up words at all.
The more you look up the faster you progress.
Try to find the balance between enjoyment and frequent lookups.

You can watch raw and try to understand only through the visuals,
watch with subs and actively look up unknown words,
or do something in between.

A community member `ﾌｪﾘﾍﾟ` shares the following routine:

> I always keep two TV-shows.
> One for mining **everything**
> and the other one for pure enjoyment, without lookups.

### Isn't 18 hours each day quite a lot?

Of course.
Khatz himself admitted that he was rarely able to do so much, but he always tried.

### What good things are there to watch for a complete beginner?

Slice of life shows.

You can divide the language into domains of interest.
The easiest domains are shows for children, slice of life and romance anime.
Most people start with them and slowly advance
until they can consume a wide variety of input and understand it perfectly.

### Kanji in the current year

Back in my day RRTK didn't exist.
The JP1K method didn't exist either.
I did KanjiDamage+.

If I were to start today I would probably start learning words right away.
If I couldn't handle it, I would pause and try the JP1K method.

### Is JAV good for immersion?

I'm guessing that's a joke.
JAV has extremely poor language density.
If you watch JAV, skip all the parts where no one's talking.

If you like erotic content, I recommend reading doujinshi.
They offer higher language density.

### What do you think of "animecards" (high quality vocab cards)?

It's one of worst plagues of the Japanese learning community.
You should never use them.
We recommend targeted sentence cards (TSCs) or fallback cards instead.

### Have you talked to Khatzumoto?

No.

### Should I believe mattvsjapan and the Refold site?

Generally, watching or reading the content he produced before around mid 2018 is safe
because he seems to be quite honest in it.
Things somewhat change when you stumble upon the content produced after that mark.
Sometimes you see him giving watered down or even dishonest advice
because he wants to appeal to a wider audience, to "normal" or "busy" people.

On this site we try to push as hardcore as we can,
so I recommend getting yourself familiar with the AJATT theory
before you engage with Matt's content.

Don't get me wrong though,
listening to mattvsjapan is still a thousand times better
than listening to what *certain* other people say on the Internet.
It's probably the second most valuable source besides the AJATT site itself.

### Should I learn kanji forms of words usually written in kana?

Yes. Khatzumoto did it all the time, and it's practically a common thing among ajatters.

Examples:
* 沢山
* 鼬
* 蝸牛
* 海豚
* 蒟蒻

### How important is passive immersion?

When you're a beginner, active immersion plays a much bigger role than passive immersion.
You need to watch something actively first and make it as comprehensible as possible
before reusing the same content for passive immersion.
At this stage it is not advised to immerse in something passively for the first time
because you haven't worked with the content and haven't comprehended it.

However, when you're already pretty good at understanding Japanese,
which happens after around a year if you're serious in your studies,
you become able to understand your passive immersion really well.
At this stage you gain a lot more from passive immersion.
When you reach this point,
you can use completely new content for passive immersion
and still understand it close to 100% if you pay enough attention.
Because of that, it makes sense to value passive immersion more as you progress.

### How can I improve at reading Japanese names?

Make an Anki deck and fill it with Japanese names.
This may include names of celebrities, politicians or even anime characters.
Most anime characters have normal Japanese names unless it's a weird fantasy show.

On the front of the card you'd have the name itself written in kanji.
On the back put the name with furigana, a photo and some basic information about the person.

Don't make cards for random people,
instead add names of people you've seen a few times before.
This is going to ensure that the names are somewhat frequent.

### What should I be "doing" while actively immersing?

Looking up words.

Active immersion is all about making your input comprehensible.
Dictionary lookups are the main way of making input comprehensible.
Besides that you can pay attention to
scenery, intonation, pitch accent, levels of politeness and other cultural things.

### What is the minimum to maintain fluency?

Depends.
The minimum to maintain fluency is highly individual.
To maintain fluency, continue immersing as frequently as you can.

The longer you have studied Japanese, the longer you can maintain your ability without immersion.
If you've studied Japanese for many years, you can even last multiple months.

### Did you track your daily immersion hours during your hardcore phase?

No, never.
[Change your environment](http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/its-not-choice-its-environment/)
and
[control your space](http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/immersion-why-you-should-stop-trying-to-control-or-measure-time/)
instead.

### How broad or narrow is a "domain" of language?

You can start feeling domain boundaries once you cross different genres.

Don't pay too much attention to domains.
Can you really imagine yourself having second-thoughts like
"I really want to immerse in this content
but I'm worried I won't enjoy it because it's in a different domain."?
Just immerse in what you like.

Having said that,
domain boundaries can pose a challenge to beginners.
Every time you switch domains, your comprehension drops.
For the first few months try to keep your domain small.

### I only do passive immersion and things aren't working, what's wrong?

Even if you have headphones on all day,
without active immersion you can't expect any improvement.
It is possible to learn a language without passive immersion,
but it is almost impossible to do with only passive immersion.
You need to actively immerse and look up as many words as you can while doing so.

### When do I make a card and when do I just keep going?

You always make a card.

### I'm not motivated and don't enjoy learning Japanese, is it still worth my time?

Don't learn Japanese.
It's just honestly stupid.
Just don't.

### What are your plans regarding moving to Japan?

As of now, I don't want to move to Japan.
You can't overlook the inherent hate for foreigners most Japanese people have.
Plus, I don't look Asian, and I don't want to stand out.

### When and how to go about dropping the SRS?

You should never stop using the SRS, even after you "make it".
A few minutes of SRSing each day is a hundred times better than no SRSing at all.

### Tae Kim: is "essential grammar" enough?

As far as I see, the Tae Kim guide is divided into 4 sections.

1) Basic Grammar
1) Essential Grammar
1) Special Expressions
1) Advanced Topics

So the question becomes, "Can I drop Tae Kim after reading the first half?"

The truth is that all 4 sections describe pretty basic grammar.
You can stop at any point and start sentence mining.
Looking up grammar and making targeted sentence cards with grammar targets
is no different from making cards for regular vocabulary.
Eventually you'll catch up.

### Should I up my active immersion?

Yes, not only active.
You should always aim at 18 hours of total immersion per day, as the AJATT site says.
After you've been ajatting for 18 months,
you can end your "hardcore phase" and start doing less immersion.
However, many choose to continue their hardcore phases until up to several years.

### Thoughts on reading before listening?

Reading is very powerful, but it harms you if you don't have enough phonetic awareness.
If I were starting today, I would keep reading at minimum for the first 6 months to a year.

### How to approach words with multiple meanings?

Usually it's enough to make just one card for one meaning,
but it's okay to make multiple cards if you think you need it.
To distinguish the cards rely on context around the target word.

### What do you think of using MCDs to train production?

Because MCDs require active recall,
they can certainly be used to train production.
However, I think that MCDs should not be used to train recognition
because TSCs do the job better.

### How to grade monolingual TSCs

TSCs are very flexible in how you can review them.
I recommend passing the card if you understand the meaning and the reading of the target word.
Don't recall the definition.

### How to develop a personality in your L2?

Unless you're a schizo you shouldn't think about it at all.

### Do you still watch anime?

I watch anime almost every day.

### How to do to monolingual RTK?

Don't do monolingual RTK, it's stupid and tedious.
Do production TSCs instead.

### How much listening should I do before I start reading?

As much as you want.
Everyone in the community has their own opinion on this.
Some even say that reading from day one is the way to go.
I recommend only audio-visual input (anime, dramas) in the beginning.
After you've done it for 2,000 to 3,000 hours (around 4 months), start reading books and manga.

### Thoughts on Khatz's "multiplexed input"

I think **condensed audio** is a better technique.
It's more organized.

### How to start reading as a beginner?

Start with reading Japanese subtitles.

### Should I put English translations on Bilingual TSCs?

You may put the corresponding line from English subs.
However, don't use Google Translate or anything like that.

### Have you ever had any plateaus? What to do when you're stuck

I haven't.
You can't be stuck if you're doing AJATT,
but you can be stuck if you slack on your immersion.

### Passive immersion playlist structure?

It should contain language-dense material that you've actively consumed before.
Intermediate learners may include podcasts in the mix.

### Do you play video games? Are video games good for immersion?

I never play video games.
Most video games should be avoided since they're proprietary.
Video games are bad for immersion because they're hard to mine from.

### Is SuperMemo better than Anki?

SuperMemo is proprietary software, so it should not be used.

### Is it ok to make cards for sentences I don't fully understand?

Make a card and save it for later instead of learning it right away.

### MorphMan for the monolingual transition?

MorphMan is terrible for everything besides counting how many words you know.

### How would you go about learning programming?

* Read books about programming.
* Get a degree.
* Study the code others wrote.
* Make Anki cards for questions and snippets you often look up.
For example, "how to shuffle a list in Python".

### Should I use pictures instead of English definitions?

Yes, for concrete nouns on your SWCs.
It's not that important for TSCs.

### How much progress can I expect in a year?

It heavily depends on how much you immerse each day.
If you're doing Japanese all the time,
after a year you can expect around 95% comprehension of your typical input.

### When should I make the monolingual transition?

Once you reach ~2000 TSCs mark.
The longer you wait the easier it becomes so don't feel guilty for slacking.

### Is learning to understand Kansai-ben difficult?

You pick it up through immersion over time.
If you study it deliberately, it's difficult.

### How strict were you about ALL Japanese ALL the time?

When I started AJATT I was a full time university student,
so it wasn't easy,
but I tried to immerse as much as possible.
I had earphones on in class and while commuting.
At home I always kept the immersion going.

### Can I get fluent with 1 hour a day?

No, but you can get fluent with 12+ hours a day.

### Should I limit how many sentences I mine from a single source?

No.

### How many water bottles do you go through in a day?

Zero.

I assume drinking from bottles is some weird American thing.
I drink from [cups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cup).

### What do you think about graded readers?

Never used them.
Don't recommend them.
AJATT is about reading stuff made for natives.

### How much reading is required to counteract not SRSing?

You can't fully counteract not SRSing.

### What is the anime you mined the most?

The first season of Steins;Gate, simply because it was the first anime I mined.

### What do you do for fun, related and unrelated to Japanese?

Watch anime.

I also make sure to spend some time immersing in English, it's both beneficial and fun.

### How many reps did you do a day on average?

300.

### What other languages do you want to learn?

Probably Polish or Czech.
