### How to learn Japanese?

You learn Japanese by self-study through immersion.
Our [guide](table-of-contents.html) contains everything you need.

### Who can teach me Japanese?

No one can.
You have to do it yourself.
Languages can only be acquired through massive amounts of watching, listening and reading.

### What's immersion?

Immersion is the process of reading or listening to your target language.
It is not necessary to move to Japan or talk to natives to immerse.
As long as you have access any content in natural, native Japanese, you're covered.
Watch anime, dramas, read books, light novels, manga in Japanese if you want to learn the language.

Usually we divide immersion into passive (background) and active.
Active immersion requires full attention to the content
while passive immersion is when you're listening to Japanese while doing something else.

### How important is passive immersion?

When you're a beginner, active immersion plays a much bigger role than passive immersion.
You need to watch something actively first and make it as comprehensible as possible
before reusing the same content for passive immersion.
At this stage it is not advised to immerse in something passively for the first time
because you haven't worked with the content and haven't comprehended it.

However, when you're already pretty good at understanding Japanese,
which happens after around a year if you're serious in your studies,
you become able to understand your passive immersion really well.
At this stage you gain a lot more from passive immersion.
When you reach this point,
you can use completely new content for passive immersion
and still understand it close to 100% if you pay enough attention.
Because of that, it makes sense to value passive immersion more as you progress.

### What's fluency?

Fluency is when you understand at least 98% of your immersion.

For example, a typical episode of anime contains 300-400 lines of dialog.
If you watch the episode and encounter only 7-8 or less unknown words,
you can call yourself fluent.

<p align="center">
	<a href="img/how_many_words_do_i_need.webp">
		<img alt="how many words do i need to know" src="img/how_many_words_do_i_need.webp">
	</a>
</p>

### What's AJATT?

AJATT is a method of reaching fluency in Japanese in a relatively short period of time.
The name AJATT stands for All Japanese All The Time,
it encourages doing as much Japanese as you can every day.
This site was inspired by the method.

### Should I read the AJATT site?

Only the [Table of Contents](http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/all-japanese-all-the-time-ajatt-how-to-learn-japanese-on-your-own-having-fun-and-to-fluency/).
Everything else isn't worth your time.
Don't enter your Email address and don't buy the paid products it offers,
there are free alternatives.

If you don't want to spend your time reading the AJATT site,
that's totally fine too.
[This site](table-of-contents.html)
covers most of its key points.

### Should I watch anime with English subtitles?

Yes, if you want to learn English.

This is actually how I learned English as a teenager, not even joking.
I was so fed up with the quality of fansubs in my native language
that one day I just decided to switch and start watching anime with English subs.
It was insanely hard at first, and I would spend hours looking up every word in a dictionary.
However, after a few months I only had to look up a couple words here and there.

If you are serious about learning Japanese, don't use English subtitles.
Watch with Japanese subtitles or without any subtitles at all.
We've all seen countless anime fans who've watched thousands of hours of English-subbed anime
and still know less than 100 Japanese words.

### If someone has watched anime with English subs for thousands of hours before starting to learn Japanese, how much of a head start does that give them?

Remember the "watch 10 000 hours of Eng subbed anime" joke from DJT?
Well, I actually did watch anime with English subs for thousands of hours
before starting to learn Japanese.
I can't talk for everybody of course,
but my experience was that
I knew literally nothing before I sat down and started formally studying the language.
I picked up probably no more than about 50 words total,
things like `お前はもう死んでいる`, `ただいま` and `馬鹿変態`.

When you're watching anime with English subtitles,
you're reading the subtitles.
You're only partially listening to the audio.
So I imagine that the only advantage a person who had an experience similar to mine
would have is a little more phonetic awareness.
They would still have to build their understanding of Japanese almost from zero.

### I am struggling to switch from English to Japanese media.

You shouldn't have this problem.
Most people before they start AJATT
already have a passion for otaku content
or other types of Japanese media.
If you decided to learn Japanese out of the blue,
and you don't like any of the above,
it's going to be very hard to immerse without going back to English.

If you like anime, there will be no temptation to watch crap in English.
But if you're not like that, then why are you learning Japanese in the first place?

### Pausing. How often should I look things up?

If you never pause it means you don't look up words at all.
The more you look up the faster you progress.
Try to find the balance between enjoyment and frequent lookups.

You can watch raw and try to understand only through the visuals,
watch with subs and actively look up unknown words,
or do something in between.

A community member `ﾌｪﾘﾍﾟ` shares the following routine:

> I always keep two TV-shows.
> One for mining **everything**
> and the other one for pure enjoyment, without lookups.

### Isn't 18 hours each day quite a lot?

Of course.
Khatz himself admitted that he was rarely able to do so much, but he always tried.

### What good things are there to watch for a complete beginner?

Slice of life shows.

You can divide the language into domains of interest.
The easiest domains are shows for children, slice of life and romance anime.
Most people start with them and slowly advance
until they can consume a wide variety of input and understand it perfectly.

A list of anime sorted from the easiest to hardest can be found
[here](random-anime-ranked-easiest-to-hardest.html).

### Kanji in the current year

Back in my day RRTK didn't exist.
The
[JP1K method](learning-kanji.html#jp1k-method)
didn't exist either.
I did KanjiDamage+.

If I were to start today, I would probably start learning words right away.
If I couldn't handle it, I would pause and try the JP1K method.

### Is it OK to create mnemonics to help remember kanji readings?

Unless you did RTK or Kanjidamage before you started reading,
creating mnemonics is not going to be that easy
because you lack a more in-depth understanding of how kanji are formed.
In this case I would recommend not worrying about mnemonics
and trying to memorize the readings as is.

If you did Kanjidamage or Kanjidamage+,
you already know thousands of premade mnemonics for kanji readings,
and they're going to help you a lot.
For me this was pretty much the case.
Kanjidamage mnemonics helped me out at first,
but I quickly moved past them as I continued to learn new words.

If you choose to use mnemonics, don't rely on them for too long.
You don't want to be an advanced learner who still thinks of mnemonic stories
when trying to read every word.

### I did RRTK but my kanji ability still feels shaky. Should I do the JP1K?

Decks like RTK, RRTK, KanjiDamage and JP1K (Kanji Transition)
are designed to give you training wheels
so that you could practice kanji in a modified environment for a while
and then transition to reading real Japanese and learn real words.

If you have completed one such deck, you don't need to do another one of the same kind.
Instead, you should go to the next level and do
[Ankidrone Starter Pack](basic-vocabulary.html).
Eventually your goal is to start sentence mining while consuming native content.

Even if you feel like you lack kanji ability,
just continuing to learn words is going to improve it.
Remember, many people never learned kanji through a dedicated deck,
they learned words right from the start.

### Is JAV good for immersion?

I'm guessing that's a joke.
JAV has extremely poor language density.
If you watch JAV, skip all the parts where no one's talking.

If you like erotic content, I recommend reading doujinshi.
They offer higher language density.

### Should I limit how much dubbed content I immerse with? What are the downsides of dubbed content?

First, it's pretty hard to find dubbed content
compared to native content in case of Japanese.
You can probably do it if you use some paid platform, but torrents contain almost nothing.
Second, Japanese has an abundance of native content
so there's no need to substitute it with dubbed content.
It's not a problem for other languages either.
For example, I was surprised how many television dramas exist in Russian,
probably even more than in Japanese,
and they make new ones every month.

Any dubbed content is stripped of basically all cultural interaction, it's just pure language.
You're going to miss out on all the body language, gestures, concepts unique to the country.
Taking this into account, dubbed content is not as good as native content,
and I advise you limit how much you use it in your immersion.

### How to look up words on web pages?

* [Yomichan](https://foosoft.net/projects/yomichan/).
* [Rikaichamp](https://addons.mozilla.org/ja/firefox/addon/rikaichamp/).
* [rikaikun](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/rikaikun/jipdnfibhldikgcjhfnomkfpcebammhp?hl=en).

I have a guide on how to set up Yomichan [here](setting-up-yomichan.html).
Don't forget to install [AnkiConnect](https://foosoft.net/projects/anki-connect/)
if you want to make Anki cards.

### How do I look up words when I read manga?

Using Tesseract and Yomichan.
The
[Mining from manga](mining-from-manga.html)
article explains how to automate it.
If Tesseract fails to OCR a certain word,
open Google Translate, enable handwriting and draw the word.

### Is SuperMemo better than Anki?

SuperMemo is proprietary software, so it should not be used.

### What time of day should I do Anki?

As long as you finish your daily reviews any time is fine.
Some people do Anki first thing in the morning,
some spread their reviews throughout the day.

### Is there a "bare minimum" amount of Anki you would recommend to people who hate Anki?

There are more people out there who hate Anki than those who like it.
I somewhat dislike Anki too.
Since around 2020 Anki has underwent significant changes that outraged the users.
Many existing add-ons break with each new release.
Maybe Anki needs to be completely replaced by another SRS.

I still use Anki because the benefits outweigh the costs.
If you hate Anki because you dread your reviews, you should just change the settings.
It is very easy to make Anki unusable by applying the wrong settings.
Try to find something that works for you.
On this site you can find my recommended settings.

The minimum amount of time you need to spend SRSing is highly individual.
As long as you can finish your daily reviews, learn new cards and add several new cards,
you should be fine.

### What is a 1T sentence?

A `1T` (one-target) sentence is a sentence
that contains only **one** word or grammar structure that you don't know.
For a more detailed explanation see
[this article](one-target-sentences.html).

### What do you think of "animecards" (high quality vocab cards)?

When people say "animecards", they mean
[WCCs](discussing-various-card-templates.html#word-context-cards).

It's one of worst plagues of the Japanese learning community.
I recommend
[targeted sentence cards](discussing-various-card-templates.html#targeted-sentence-cards-or-mpvacious-cards)
(TSCs) or fallback cards instead.

### How should I go about making cards for words that are written identically but pronounced differently?

When you spot a pair of words that are written identically but read differently,
make TSCs with those words and use furigana with <span title="ばつ mark">×</span> on the front
to distinguish between the readings.
I have given examples [here](discussing-various-card-templates.html#distinguishing-readings).

### Anki to immersion ratio. How much time should I spend SRSing?

The most popular community guideline is 1 hour a day.

You can't directly control how much time you're going to spend on Anki.
The amount of time is determined by what card type (template) you use,
how many new cards you add each day
and how fast you can read Japanese.

If you notice that you overspend you time on Anki,
try TSCs or fallback cards instead of normal sentence cards,
reduce the number of new cards you learn,
install [Speed Focus Mode](useful-anki-add-ons-for-japanese.html#speed-focus-mode)
Anki add-on.

### How should I divide my study time?

Roughly in three parts.

* Spend 1/3 of your time reading, 1/3 listening and 1/3 doing Anki.
* Don't spend more than 1 hour a day on Anki, distribute the rest.
* Watching TV with subtitles counts towards reading.

So, on a bad day when you have only 3 hours of study time,
you do each activity for 1 hour.
On a good day when you have 12 hours a day,
you spend 1 hour on Anki,
5.5 hours on listening and 5.5 on reading.

### How many new cards to learn each day?

I recommend learning 10 to 30 new cards a day.
The more new cards you do, the more reviews you'll have complete.
See [New cards](how-to-review.html#new-cards).

### Should I read sentences aloud when doing Anki reps?

I don't necessarily recommend it.
See [Reading sentences aloud](how-to-review.html#reading-sentences-aloud).

### How to make monolingual TSCs for vocab and grammar?

The process of making monolingual TSCs for grammar and vocab is the same
because there's no significant difference between the two.

* Download and install monolingual
[dictionaries](yomichan-and-epwing-dictionaries.html)
for Yomichan.
* Keep JMdict enabled for times when your monolingual dictionaries don't pick up certain words.
* Mine words as usual, delete English from your cards.

Grammar points often only have English definitions.
Rely on Yomichan to pin-point the grammar pattern, then use
[Weblio](https://www.weblio.jp/),
[sakura-paris](https://sakura-paris.org/dict/)
or any search engine to look it up.

Some people would prefer to install as many monolingual dictionaries as possible
to cover more ground and minimize the need to look up words online.

### How to review and grade TSCs?

TSCs are very flexible in how you can review them.

When you learn a card for the first time,
read the full sentence and understand its meaning as a whole,
as well as meanings of individual words in isolation.

When you review the card later,
you can choose not to read the whole sentence
and instead only read the target word.
Read the word then reveal the back of the card and read the definition.

Pass the card if you understand the meaning and reading of the target word.
A definition is just one of many possible ways to describe the word.
Don't recall the definition in case of a monolingual card,
or the translation in case of a bilingual card verbatim.
Having a general idea of the meaning in your head is enough.

### How should I review monolingual word cards?

If it's a concrete noun, recall how it looks or what it is.
If not, you're better off making a TSC instead.

As I've said, don't recall the whole definition verbatim.

### Should I trust Cure Dolly and "Organic Japanese"?

Sometimes you see people recommending Cure Dolly as a replacement for the Tae Kim grammar guide.
I tried going through it, and here's my takeaway.

* The grammar explanations are a complete joke.
I'm not saying that any competitors are perfectly correct either
because they rely on English to describe Japanese,
but Cure Dolly is on a different level.
* Cure Dolly is creepy. Not everyone's going to have enough willpower to sit through its voice.
* It is long.
Most of the content is in video format.
I'm not a big fan of videos.
Reading a written grammar guide is going to be more efficient.

In order to understand grammar you have to understand it in Japanese.
When a guide uses English building blocks to make a model that resembles the Japanese grammar,
there's a limit on how accurate the explanations can be.

On this site we recommend reading Tae Kim
to acquire a rough understanding
of what each of the most common grammar patterns means
in order to comprehend more of your input.
We don't concern ourselves with how to apply the rules to produce Japanese,
this is something that comes naturally with immersion.
Later after you become fluent we advise learning Japanese grammar in Japanese,
using resources meant for native speakers.

### Should I trust mattvsjapan and the "Refold" site?

Generally, watching or reading the content he produced before around mid 2018 is safe
because he seems to be quite honest in it.
But in recent years Matt has been criticized by many people for watering down the method
and making it less effective
because he wanted to appeal to a wider audience.

On this site we try to push as hardcore as we can,
so I recommend getting yourself familiar with the AJATT theory
before you engage with Refold's content.
It will enable you to **distinguish** hardcore advice from advice for the general audience.

Don't get me wrong though,
listening to mattvsjapan is still a thousand times better
than listening to what *certain* other people say on the Internet.
It's probably one of the most valuable sources after this site and the AJATT site.

### How much more efficient is AJATT than Refold?

Refold is a copy of AJATT with some parts reworded.
There isn't much difference between the two,
*except With Refold you have to buy the T-shirts and cups from their store
and subscribe for monthly donations to keep progressing.*

I'm not that knowledgeable about Refold's teachings,
but I understand that Refold was designed to be less effective than AJATT.
Depending on how much time you have for immersion, what you immerse with, and how you use Anki
you can progress faster, and I wish you do.

### Is there a Japanese syntax parser similar to Jisho.org but with no English?

[Mecab](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/mecab/).

### Should I learn kanji forms of words usually written in kana?

Yes. Khatzumoto did it all the time, and it's practically a common thing among ajatters.

Examples:
* 沢山
* 鼬
* 蝸牛
* 海豚
* 蒟蒻

If you can read the kanji, then you can automatically read the kana.
But if you can read the kana, it doesn't mean that you can read the kanji.
By learning the kanji version you're getting both at the same time.

If you already have a targeted sentence card that teaches the kanji version of a word,
then the next time you make a card that has that word in it,
you don't have to change it to kanji because it's not the **target word** anymore.

### How can I improve at reading Japanese names?

Make an Anki deck and fill it with Japanese names.
This may include names of celebrities, politicians or even anime characters.
Most anime characters have normal Japanese names unless it's a weird fantasy show.

On the front of the card you'd have the name itself written in kanji.
On the back put the name with furigana, a photo and some basic information about the person.

Don't make cards for random people,
instead add names of people you've seen a few times before.
This is going to ensure that the names are somewhat frequent.

### In order to increase my reading speed, should I force myself to start skimming?

Khatzumoto recommended skimming mostly as a motivational tool.
You skim boring parts to get to the fun parts, and it keeps you focused on your immersion.
When it comes to reading speed, skimming won't help.
If you read a lot, your reading speed will improve naturally.

### Should I use a smaller font when reading to get used to small fonts?

Avoid small fonts, they're bad for your eyes.

Because today almost all reading is done on a computer,
you can set a larger font no problem.
Plus, computers make lookups and sentence mining easier.

Some printed books are written in small fonts,
but you don't need to practice reading small fonts in order to read them.
If you can read Japanese in a larger font fluently,
you're going to be able to read smaller fonts too.

### What about reading physical books?

I don't recommend reading physical books because usually they're not free,
and they're harder to mine from.
Almost all digital books are free,
and you can use Yomichan with them,
which is a great advantage.

### Can I use Netflix to learn Japanese?

Please read this excellent article by Richard Stallman:
[Reasons not to use Netflix](https://stallman.org/netflix.html).
There are plenty of ways to
[obtain](resources.html#immersion-material)
immersion material
and keep your freedom.

### Should I buy a Kindle to read Japanese books?

No, please!
If you already have one, get rid of it.
Amazon Swindle is a malicious device designed to handcuff you.

Read the following:

* https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-call-it-the-swindle.html
* https://stallman.org/amazon.html
* https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/ebooks-must-increase-freedom.html
* https://www.defectivebydesign.org/amazon-kindle-swindle

### What should I be "doing" while actively immersing?

Looking up words.

Active immersion is all about making your input comprehensible.
Dictionary lookups are the main way of making input comprehensible.
Aside from that you can pay attention to
scenery, intonation, pitch accent, levels of politeness and other cultural things.

### What is the minimum to maintain fluency?

Depends.
The minimum to maintain fluency is highly individual.
To maintain fluency, continue immersing as frequently as you can.

The longer you have studied Japanese, the longer you can maintain your ability without immersion.
If you've studied Japanese for many years, you can even last multiple months.

### Did you track your daily immersion hours during your hardcore phase?

No, never.
[Change your environment](http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/its-not-choice-its-environment/)
and
[control your space](http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/immersion-why-you-should-stop-trying-to-control-or-measure-time/)
instead.

> It's much easier to control space than to control time.

> If you change your environment then, you won't have to "choose" anything.
> Your environment will essentially make your choices for you.

> Don't [choose to] do Japanese. Only have Japanese to do.

In other words, if you only have Japanese books, TV and movies at hand,
immersing in Japanese is the only thing you can do.
All your time is immersion time, so you don't have to measure it.

For a strange reason everybody I've met
who tried to measure how much time they spent on Japanese
weren't actually that good.
They were so focused on optimizing their immersion that they didn't immerse.

### How broad or narrow is a "domain" of language?

You can start feeling domain boundaries once you cross different genres.

Don't pay too much attention to domains.
Can you really imagine yourself having second-thoughts like
"I really want to immerse in this content,
but I'm worried I won't enjoy it because it's in a different domain."?
Just immerse in what you like.

Having said that,
domain boundaries can pose a challenge to beginners.
Every time you switch domains, your comprehension drops.
For the first few months try to keep your domain small.

### How to extract audio from immersion content for passive listening?

Learn how to use
[FFmpeg](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/FFmpeg)
from the terminal.
It's very versatile.

I also recommend that you take a look at
[impd](https://github.com/Ajatt-Tools/impd).
It's a program that is specifically designed to automatically manage background immersion.

### I only do passive immersion and things aren't working, what's wrong?

Even if you have headphones on all day,
without active immersion you can't expect any improvement.
It is possible to learn a language without passive immersion,
but it is almost impossible to do with only passive immersion.
You need to actively immerse and look up as many words as you can while doing so.

### Watching raw or watching with Japanese subs?

Both have their advantages.
When you watch with Japanese subs, you train your reading comprehension.
When you watch raw, you train your listening comprehension.
Try to balance the two.

No matter what you choose, it is important that you watch raw at least some of the time.
If you always watch with subs, your listening ability won't be improving.
I suggest that you watch raw
and only turn the subs on when you don't understand something.

### When do I make a card and when do I just keep going?

You always make a card.

If you're feeling lazy then just don't.
Immersion learning is not math,
you're not going to get a bad grade if you don't learn something.
If the word is important, it will come up again.

### I'm not motivated and don't enjoy learning Japanese, is it still worth my time?

Don't learn Japanese.

It's just honestly stupid.

Just don't.

### When and how to go about dropping the SRS?

You should never stop using the SRS, even after you "make it".
A few minutes of SRSing each day is a hundred times better than no SRSing at all.

### What do you think of the Core 6K deck? Is it a good replacement for the Tango decks?

You don't need to "replace" Tango decks with anything.
You'll find both decks in AnkiDrone Starter Pack.
Try them, see which you like more.
Core 6K is a part of Core 10K.

Core 10K and Tango are quite similar.
Both are TSC decks with vocabulary and sentences voiced by a native speaker.
I recommend Tango over Core10k.
In Tango the sentences are a little more natural,
and the presented vocabulary looks more useful in everyday life.

### Should I read through Tae Kim while going through the Tango decks?

Only if you don't understand some cards in the deck.

Tango decks don't teach grammar points as thoroughly as a grammar guide would do.
If you stumble upon a card that you don't understand even after reading its back,
refer to Tae Kim for explanations.

### Tae Kim: is "essential grammar" enough?

As far as I see, the Tae Kim guide gets divided into 4 sections.

1) Basic Grammar
1) Essential Grammar
1) Special Expressions
1) Advanced Topics

So the question becomes, "Can I drop Tae Kim after reading the first half?"

The truth is that all 4 sections describe pretty basic grammar.
You can stop at any point and start sentence mining.
Looking up grammar and making targeted sentence cards with grammar targets
is no different from making cards for regular vocabulary.
Eventually you'll catch up.

### I'm a beginner. Do you recommend learning the "advanced grammar" within Tae Kim's grammar guide?

The above answer applies.

When I learned Japanese, I read Tae Kim's guide completely, but I did it in chunks.
First I learned some vocab, then I read the first section.
Then I learned more vocab and read the second one, and so on.

Decide if you're ready before starting the "advanced grammar" part.

### When should I change my devices to Japanese?

When you can read Japanese comfortably.

User interfaces use a limited range of relatively specific vocabulary.
If you want to speed things up,
frontload the vocabulary before switching your devices.
[Here](https://gist.github.com/tatsumoto-ren/844c4a36491aee2820d09f4852c18172)
I have a list of sentences ripped from Android's system UI.
Go through the list and use Yomichan to make cards for words you don't know.

### Should I up my active immersion?

Yes, not only active.
You should always aim at 18 hours of total immersion per day, as the AJATT site says.
After you've been ajatting for 18 months,
you can end your "hardcore phase" and start doing less immersion.
However, many choose to continue their hardcore phases until up to several years.

### Thoughts on reading before listening?

Reading is very powerful, but it harms you if you don't have enough phonetic awareness.
If I were starting today, I would keep reading at minimum for the first 6 months to a year.

### What's more harmful: early output or letting your reading ability get too far ahead of your listening ability?

Both are undoubtedly dangerous, but why are you worrying about this?
If you're aware that reading dominates your immersion, cut it out and listen more.
Immerse the right way, and everything will be fine.

### I have many bad habits due to being forced to prematurely output for many years in school. How should I go about fixing these bad habits?

What is usually recommended in this case is to go through a silent period.
Don't output and listen a lot for up to a year.
To fix the habits that may still be present after a silent period
study tongue placement and imitate native speakers.

### How to approach words with multiple meanings?

Usually it's enough to make just one card for one meaning,
but it's okay to make multiple cards if you think you need it.
To distinguish the cards rely on context around the target word.

### What do you think of using MCDs to train production?

Because MCDs require active recall,
they can certainly be used to train production.
However, I think that MCDs should not be used to train recognition
because TSCs do the job better.

### How to develop a personality in your L2?

Unless you're a schizo, you shouldn't think about it at all.

### How to do monolingual RTK?

Don't do monolingual RTK, it's stupid and tedious.
After you've achieved basic fluency, do production TSCs instead.

### I'm struggling with kanji while working through Tango decks. Should I go through RTK?

I wouldn't recommend that.
Try the [JP1K method](learning-kanji.html#jp1k-method) instead.

### I just learned that I was reviewing the Kanji Transition deck completely wrong. What should I do from here?

It clearly means that the [JP1K method](learning-kanji.html#jp1k-method) is not for you.
You should switch to [Ankidrone Starter Pack](basic-vocabulary.html).
When doing Ankidrone, try to learn each word as is, through so-called brute force method.
Memorize how the word is read and what it means.
If you notice that you can't force kanji readings into your memory,
you have to prime your mind for kanji first.
Pause Ankidrone and do [Kanjidamage+](learning-kanji.html#isolated-kanji-study).

### How to learn readings after finishing isolated kanji study?

Readings should not be learned in isolation.
You're going to learn words with their readings at the same time.
You need to read Japanese, look up words and make TSCs.

At first, you may want to use a premade deck.
I recommend downloading
[Ankidrone Starter Pack](basic-vocabulary.html)
and learning 1-3 thousand words from it.

### I forget kanji readings in sentences. Should I use furigana?

If you add furigana on the front of your cards, you're not going to learn the readings.
One of the points of using the SRS is to learn kanji readings, so you're defeating the point.

What I always did is I followed
[Wozniak's recommendations](https://www.supermemo.com/archives1990-2015/articles/20rules)
and memorized different representations of a particular kanji.
So, I would take the kanji I have trouble remembering and look it up on Jisho.org
[like this](https://jisho.org/search/%EF%BC%8A%E8%BD%A2%EF%BC%8A).
Then I would deliberately find example sentences with the words and make Anki cards.

### Do your Tango decks have audio or text on the front? Which way is better?

Ankidrone Starter Pack contains bilingual TSCs with sentences on the front.
Don't put audio on the front of your cards.

### How to rep audio-based sentence cards?

By pressing `Ctrl+Delete`.
Audio-based cards are completely useless.

### How much listening should I do before I start reading?

As much as you want.
Everyone in the community has their own opinion on this.
Some even say that reading from day one is the way to go.
I recommend only audio-visual input (anime, dramas) in the beginning.
After you've done it for 2,000 to 3,000 hours (around 4 months), start reading books and manga.

### Thoughts on Khatz's "multiplexed input"

I think [condensed audio](passive-listening.html#condensing-audio) is a better technique.
It's more organized.

### How to start reading as a beginner?

Start with reading Japanese subtitles.

### Should I put English translations on Bilingual TSCs?

You may put the corresponding line from English subs.
However, don't use Google Translate or anything like that.

### Passive immersion playlist structure?

It should contain language-dense material that you've actively consumed before.
Intermediate learners may include podcasts in the mix.

### Thoughts on listening to podcasts while playing a video game?

1) I recommend quitting playing video games completely.
2) Listening to podcasts in your TL is a good idea if you're at a stage where
your level of comprehension allows you to understand them without much effort.
Mind that podcasts are usually harder to comprehend due to a lack of visuals and transcriptions.

### Is it OK to make cards for sentences I don't fully understand?

Make a card and save it for later instead of learning it right away.

### What are your current thoughts on removing cards once they pass a certain interval?

The idea of removing (or suspending) cards once they reach a certain interval is harmful,
especially if the interval is relatively short.
Once you delete a card, you can't be sure that you will remember it when you need it.

I would speculate that this idea was born
in an attempt to lower the review load caused by using sentence cards.
Sentence cards take longer to review compared to other card types.
In order to lower review load people suspend older cards
and only spend time on relatively young cards.

Instead of sentence cards I recommend you use targeted sentence cards
because they allow you to take shortcuts and review faster.

It's alright to delete cards once they reach obscene intervals like 10-15 years.
To find such cards, you can open the Anki Browser and type `prop:ivl>3650`.
The number `3650` corresponds to card's interval in days.

### I would like to start adding pitch accent to my cards. How should I grade the cards once I add pitch accent?

Don't change anything in the grading process.
Just have pitch accent information on the back of your cards
but don't take it into account when grading yourself.
To learn pitch accent of individual words make separate cards.
Have a word on the front of the card and its pitch accent on the back.

### Google or Microsoft IME?

Both Microsoft and Google IMEs are proprietary, and thus are
[malware](https://www.gnu.org/proprietary/).
I recommend
[Fcitx](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Fcitx)
with kkc or any other free/libre input method.

### How do I add a directory to the PATH?

Let's say you want to add `~/.local/bin` to the PATH.
According to
[Arch Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Environment_variables#Per_user),
to add a directory to the PATH for local usage, put following in `~/.bash_profile`:

```
export PATH="${PATH}:${HOME}/.local/bin"
```

Replace `${HOME}/.local/bin` with the path of the directory you want to add.
If you use
[zsh](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Zsh),
instead of `~/.bash_profile` edit `~/.zprofile`.

### What are your current thoughts on Morphman? Do you recommend it?

I used
[Morphman](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/900801631)
for brief periods of time in 2018-2019.
I always disliked its card sorting feature because of how intrusive it is.
I don't use Morphman anymore, and I don't recommend it for intermediate learners,
but beginners may benefit from it.

This is how I recommend using Morphman:

0) Have a large enough sentence bank.
2,000+ sentences are going to be enough.
You can use
[subs2srs](our-immersion-learning-toolset.html#subs2srs)
to generate sentence banks.
1) Install Morphman, set it up.
2) Recalculate the database, then **disable** the add-on.
3) Morphman will have tagged all cards that it thinks are
[1T](one-target-sentences.html)
for you.
Manually pick what cards you're going to learn from the ones marked as `1T`.

If you don't understand how to use Morphman,
search for a guide online.
I recommend
[this](https://web.archive.org/web/20201220134610if_/https://massimmersionapproach.com/table-of-contents/anki/morphman/)
guide written by mattvsjapan.

guide by OhTalkWho.

### MorphMan for the monolingual transition?

Back in the day I saw a bizarre method of going monolingual
by sorting J-J definitions with Morphman and sentence mining them.
Though such an approach will work, it's too complicated and extremely tedious.

### How would you go about learning programming?

* Read books about programming.
* Get a degree.
* Study the code others wrote.
* Make Anki cards for questions and snippets you often look up.
For example, "how to shuffle a list in Python".

### Should I use pictures instead of English definitions?

Yes, for concrete nouns on your SWCs.
It's not that important for TSCs.

### How much progress can I expect in a year?

It heavily depends on how much you immerse each day.
If you're doing Japanese all the time,
after a year you can expect around 95% comprehension of your typical input.

### When should I make the monolingual transition?

Once you reach ~2000 TSCs mark.
The longer you wait the easier it becomes so don't feel guilty for slacking.

### Is learning to understand Kansai-ben difficult?

You pick it up through immersion over time.
If you study it deliberately, it's difficult.

### Can I get fluent with 1 hour a day?

No, but you can get fluent with 12+ hours a day.

### I want to learn a difficult language (Japanese) and an easy language (Spanish). Should I learn them at the same time?

It is possible if you manage it, but I don't recommend it.
Learn the easy one first and do
[laddering](http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/how-to-learn-multiple-languages-without-getting-confused-the-laddering-method/).

### What is your opinion on learning an L3 by using L2 resources ("laddering")?

That's how I learned Japanese.
I exclusively used resources in my L2.

I wouldn't recommend using your L2 just because it's your L2.
Use the language that has the best resources.
Usually it's the closest language to your TL.
For example, you can use Korean resources to learn Japanese
or Russian resources to learn Ukrainian,
assuming you know those languages of course.

Another point is that if you keep using L2 resources for the sake of laddering,
it will slow you down.
Any language is better learned using resources made in the language itself.
Switch to TL resources as soon as possible.

### What are your current recommendations related to how to sentence mine?

It's basically 90% Yomichan use.
For movies and TV shows, I recommend mpv scripts.
For manga, refer to my "Mining from manga" article to set up Tesseract.
When you can't use the sentence you've encountered the word in,
try to find [example sentences online](resources.html#examples-and-pronunciations).

### How do you learn how to write Japanese?

See my [Writing Japanese](writing-japanese.html) article.

If you want to learn how to write in Japanese,
bear in mind that it's going to take a lot of time.
You may want to reach a reasonable level of fluency before you choose to do that.

If you want to live in Japan,
writing Japanese is going to be important.
Otherwise, only learn to write if you're passionate about it.
These days the ability to produce kanji from memory isn't nearly as important as it used to be.
Most people type on their phones or computers, and typing is done phonetically.

### Should I limit how many sentences I mine from a single source?

No.

### Should I make mnemonics to learn new words?

No.

### How do Japanese people pronounce “?” and “!”?

* [疑問符](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%96%91%E5%95%8F%E7%AC%A6)
* [感嘆符](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%84%9F%E5%98%86%E7%AC%A6)

### How to type the ￥ symbol with Fcitx?

To type `￥` (pronounced 円マーク), press `＼` (backslash) and hit the space bar.
This will give you the IME's prediction as to what character you want to insert.
If the prediction is incorrect, hit the space bar again until you find `￥`.

### How much reading is required to counteract not SRSing?

You can't fully counteract not SRSing.

### What Japanese documentaries do you recommend?

Nothing in particular comes to my mind, but in general
[NHK specials](https://www.nhk.jp/p/special/ts/2NY2QQLPM3/)
are pretty good.
You can find the videos on
[Nyaa ISS](https://nyaa.iss.one/?q=ＮＨＫスペシャル).

### What do you think about graded readers?

Never used them.
Don't recommend them.
AJATT is about reading stuff made for natives.

### Why should I avoid Discord, Reddit, 4chan, etc.?

#### Discord

Discord is substantially worse than any other messaging app.
It's a proprietary spyware program.
They call it "Discord servers" but that's a lie.
You don't really have your own Discord server.
It's not free software, you can't actually host it yourself and do anything, it's not serious.
Most people there have no idea what they're saying, they don't know Japanese.
It's gaymer trash.

#### Reddit

Recaptcha is required to register.
Absolutely terrible privacy policy.
People who don't know any Japanese.
Requires JavaScript to function.

#### 4chan

~~Recaptcha is required for every post.~~
Blocks TOR, VPN and proxies.
Requires JavaScript to function.

### Any good Japanese learning communities?

* [DJT](join-our-community.html)
* [Nanochan/a/](http://nanochanqzaytwlydykbg5nxkgyjxk3zsrctxuoxdmbx5jbh2ydyprid.onion/a/)
* Various Matrix rooms
* Some Telegram chats

### How do I change language in Telegram to Japanese?

Visit the official [Japanese translation](https://translations.telegram.org/ja) page.

### Are there any language learning YouTubers that you like? What YouTubers do you like in general?

I don't watch YouTube because almost all content it offers is low quality.
I can't recall any good language learning content ever posted on YouTube.
If you want to familiarize yourself with language learning theory, search written guides online.
It will take you less time to go through them because reading generally is faster than listening.

When it comes to immersion content, however, YouTube can offer something you'll like.
Things like streams, podcasts or news are good to listen to, especially for passive immersion.

These are some things to keep in mind when watching something on YouTube:

1) Do not let YouTube track you.
Spying on YouTube is an important part of the data mining operation Google is running.
By not letting them collect any data about you, you're protecting your privacy.
2) Do not give videos any views.
When a person who uploaded a video sees that their video is getting views,
they think that they can continue getting away with using YouTube.
They might even earn money from YouTube showing ads to the viewers.
This is not what we want,
we want everyone to upload videos to privacy-respecting platforms like Odysee or Peertube.

To ensure you're not being tracked
and that you're not giving any authors incentives to continue uploading to YouTube,
either download all videos you want to watch with
[Youtube-dl](mining-from-movies-and-tv-shows.html#youtube-dl)
and watch them later
or use a proxy site such as
[Invidious](https://redirect.invidious.io/).
Invidious lets you choose from a number of instances based on their health.
If you go to the YouTube website, keep
[Watch on Odysee](https://github.com/kodxana/Watch-on-Odysee)
enabled to be notified when an alternative Odysee version of the video is available.

### What are your thoughts on timeboxing?

Ever since I found out about timeboxing from the
[AJATT site](http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/secrets-to-smoother-srsing-part-5-timeboxing/),
I've been applying it almost every day.
I usually stick to a simple [pomodoro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) routine,
but sometimes I use shorter intervals.

### What is the anime you mined the most?

The first season of Steins;Gate, simply because it was the first anime I mined.

### How many water bottles do you go through in a day?

Zero.

I assume drinking from bottles is some weird American thing.
I drink from [cups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cup).

### What do you do for fun, related and unrelated to Japanese?

Watch anime.

I also make sure to spend some time immersing in English, it's both beneficial and fun.

### How many reps did you do a day on average?

My daily average was ~300 cards.

### What other languages do you want to learn?

Probably Polish or Czech.

### How strict were you about ALL Japanese ALL the time?

When I started AJATT I was a full time university student,
so it wasn't easy,
but I tried to immerse as much as possible.
I had earphones on in class and while commuting.
At home, I always kept the immersion going.

### How has learning Japanese changed your outlook on language learning?

Before I started learning Japanese I had been learning English for many years.
I knew that to progress I had to watch and read a lot of native content,
I also knew that classes and textbooks don't help.
I had an intuitive understanding of how one should learn a language,
but I knew nothing about Krashen, AJATT and immersion learning.

Discovering AJATT helped me understand why what I did to learn English worked.
It gave me a systemic view on language acquisition and a framework to talk about immersion learning.

### Do you still watch anime?

I watch anime almost every day.

### Have you talked to Khatzumoto?

No.

### What are your plans regarding moving to Japan?

As of now, I don't want to move to Japan.
Many Japanese people are very xenophobic, and you can't overlook that.
Plus, I don't look Asian, and I don't want to stand out.

### Do you play video games? Are video games good for immersion?

I never play video games.
Most video games should be avoided since they're proprietary.
Video games are bad for immersion because they're hard to mine from.

### Have you ever had any plateaus? What to do when you're stuck?

I haven't.
You can't be stuck if you're doing AJATT,
but you can be stuck if you slack on your immersion.

### What operating system do you use?

On my desktop and laptop,
I use the [GNU operating system](https://www.gnu.org/)
with [linux-hardened](https://github.com/anthraxx/linux-hardened).
And the distribution of GNU that I use is [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/).

On mobile, I use [LineageOS](https://lineageos.org/) without Google Apps.

### Top 10 anime of all time?

1) [Watashi ni Tenshi ga Maiorita](https://myanimelist.net/anime/37993)
1) [Mitsuboshi Colors](https://myanimelist.net/anime/35078)
1) [Yuru Yuri](https://myanimelist.net/anime/10495)
1) [Adachi to Shimamura](https://myanimelist.net/anime/39790)
1) [Gochuumon wa Usagi Desu ka](https://myanimelist.net/anime/21273)
1) [Gabriel DropOut](https://myanimelist.net/anime/33731)
1) [Machikado Mazoku](https://myanimelist.net/anime/39071)
1) [Comic Girls](https://myanimelist.net/anime/35756)
1) [Kiniro Mosaic](https://myanimelist.net/anime/16732)
1) [Ichigo Mashimaro](https://myanimelist.net/anime/488)

Just off the top of my head.
The order doesn't imply anything.
