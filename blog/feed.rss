Setting up Qolibri</title><description><![CDATA[
<p><a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/qolibri/">Qolibri</a>
is a Qt-based dictionary viewer.
It lets you search multiple dictionaries at one time
so for every word you look up you immediately get multiple definitions.
Qolibri remains one of the most widely used Japanese dictionary viewers for GNU/Linux.</p>
<p>By itself, Qolibri is just a viewer.
To utilize it, you need <strong>dictionary files</strong>.
The dictionary files Qolibri reads are called <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPWING">EPWING</a>s.
EPWING (electronic publishing WING) is a dictionary format
that was allegedly utilized in portable electronic dictionaries.</p>
<p>Qolibri is much better at searching a big number of dictionaries at the same time than Yomichan.
If you try to use more than 5 dictionaries with Yomichan,
it quickly becomes very cluttered and hard to navigate.
Qolibri lists all dictionaries you have on a sidebar.
It is easy to jump between them if you need to.</p>
<p>If you haven't started using Japanese to Japanese dictionaries yet,
feel free to skip this article for now.
Though Japanese to English dictionaries for Qolibri exist, their number is not very large.
The main reason you want to use the program is to browse monolingual dictionaries.</p>

One target sentences</title><description><![CDATA[
<p>Let's define a &quot;target&quot; as any unknown piece of information
in a given sentence in a foreign language.
It can be either a word or a grammar structure.
We can divide all sentences we encounter while immersing in our target language into three groups:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>0T</code>, zero-target.
Sentences that don't contain anything you don't already know.</li>
<li><code>1T</code>, one-target.
Sentences that contain one unknown piece of information.</li>
<li><code>2T+</code>, <code>MT</code>, multi-target.
Sentences that contain multiple unknown pieces of information.</li>
</ol>

How to review</title><description><![CDATA[
<p>Though Anki is an excellent piece of software,
you can learn languages more effectively if you tweak some settings and know how to review.
Even if you're using Anki for something other than studying human languages,
this article may still help you.</p>

Japanese fonts</title><description><![CDATA[
<p>On a freshly installed GNU/Linux distro
Japanese characters may not look pretty.
This can be fixed by installing
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Localization/Japanese#Fonts">Japanese fonts</a>
and creating a proper
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Font_configuration">Fontconfig</a>
configuration file.</p>

Mining from movies and TV-shows</title><description><![CDATA[
<p><em>Sentence mining</em> is the process of picking sentences from your immersion and making Anki cards.
Each sentence has one unknown piece of information,
which is referred to as <em>target word</em>.</p>
<p>To mine sentences from movies and TV-shows
you are going to need the mpv video player,
and a plugin for mpv called mpvacious.</p>

Learning Kanji</title><description><![CDATA[
<p>Unlike kana which you can learn in a matter of few days no matter what method you pick,
learning kanji is apparently more difficult, and there are many methods of doing it.</p>
<p>To pick the right method
you have to understand why you want to learn kanji in the first place.
The &quot;practice how you play&quot; principle applies here as well.
Kanji do not exist in a vacuum, instead they're used to writing Japanese words,
so in order to &quot;learn&quot; them all you need to do is learn words.
To learn a word means to memorize how it's read and what it means.
Over time as you keep learning words you unconsciously get better at recognizing the kanji.</p>
<p>We advise against learning kanji readings in isolation.
Very often a kanji character has a number of completely different readings.
Not only learning all of them is an enormous task,
but it's impossible to apply the knowledge to real native content when reading.</p>

Foreword</title><description><![CDATA[
<p>Congratulations! You've taken your first step towards learning Japanese!</p>
<p>I'm Tatsumoto. I'm primarily known for a <a href="https://t.me/ajatt_tools">Telegram channel</a>
with focus on helping foreigners learn Japanese language.</p>
<p>This site is a quickstart guide for the subscribers
and anyone who wants to build a solid understanding of the Japanese language.
We focus on understanding before speaking, or input before output.
We believe doing so is the shortest path to fluency,
because you avoid whole groups of problems that come with premature output,
such as foreign accent and grammar mistakes.
This approach makes the journey easy and fun
because from day one you are encouraged to learn from compelling content
made for native speakers of your target language.
Most people who persevered and reached fluency
watched their favorite TV shows in Japanese
and read lots of books and manga every day.
No amount of brute force can get you there,
so forget about traditional approaches such as taking classes or hiring a tutor.</p>
