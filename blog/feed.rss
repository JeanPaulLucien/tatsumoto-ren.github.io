JLPT Tango N2 Anki deck</title><description><![CDATA[
<p align="center">
<img src="img/tango_n2.webp" alt="cover" style="max-height: 400px;">
</p>
<p>2500 Essential Vocabulary for the JLPT N2,
also known as JLPT Tango N2,
is a textbook to prepare for the JLPT N2.
It contains ~1,500 Japanese sentences and their English translations.
The book includes vocabulary found commonly on the JLPT and often used in everyday life.</p>
<p>With the help of our chat members,
we have created an Anki deck specifically for the JLPT Tango N2.
We took sentences from the book,
downloaded audio from the publisher's website
and combined them to make this Anki deck.</p>

Sentence mining</title><description><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Sentence mining</strong> is a process of extracting sentences
that contain unknown words
from the content you read, watch or listen to in your target language
and adding them to Anki in a form of targeted sentence cards (TSCs).
You put an example sentence in the question field
and the definitions, pictures and pronunciations in the answer field.</p>
<p>Sentence mining and immersion are the two most important components of our method.
Immersion provides you with new vocabulary to be mined,
and mined sentences become fuel that advances your language learning.</p>
<p>Finding your own sentences is much more fun than learning from a premade deck,
or, god forbid, a textbook.
Because you're creating Anki cards out of vocabulary found in your immersion,
you're always learning what is relevant to you.
Once you reach this stage, it is way harder to quit Japanese,
as the foundation is already in place.</p>

Setting up Qolibri</title><description><![CDATA[
<p><a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/qolibri/">Qolibri</a>
is a Qt-based dictionary viewer.
It lets you search multiple dictionaries at one time
so for every word you look up you immediately get multiple definitions.
Qolibri remains one of the most widely used Japanese dictionary viewers for GNU/Linux.</p>
<p>By itself, Qolibri is just a viewer.
To utilize it, you need <strong>dictionary files</strong>.
The dictionary files Qolibri reads are called <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPWING">EPWING</a>s.
EPWING (electronic publishing WING) is a dictionary format
that was allegedly utilized in portable electronic dictionaries.</p>
<p>Qolibri is much better at searching a big number of dictionaries at the same time than Yomichan.
If you try to use more than 5 dictionaries with Yomichan,
it quickly becomes very cluttered and hard to navigate.
Qolibri lists all dictionaries you have on a sidebar.
It is easy to jump between them if you need to.</p>
<p>If you haven't started using Japanese to Japanese dictionaries yet,
feel free to skip this article for now.
Though Japanese to English dictionaries for Qolibri exist, their number is not very large.
The main reason you want to use the program is to browse monolingual dictionaries.</p>

One target sentences</title><description><![CDATA[
<p>Let's define a &quot;target&quot; as any unknown piece of information
in a given sentence in a foreign language.
It can be either a word or a grammar structure.
We can divide all sentences we encounter while immersing in our target language into three groups:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>0T</code>, zero-target.
Sentences that don't contain anything you don't already know.</li>
<li><code>1T</code>, one-target.
Sentences that contain one unknown piece of information.</li>
<li><code>2T+</code>, <code>MT</code>, multi-target.
Sentences that contain multiple unknown pieces of information.</li>
</ol>

How to review</title><description><![CDATA[
<p>Though Anki is an excellent piece of software,
you can learn languages more effectively if you tweak some settings and know how to review.
Even if you're using Anki for something other than studying human languages,
this article may still help you.</p>

<p>On a freshly installed GNU/Linux distro
Japanese characters may not look pretty.
This can be fixed by installing

Mining from movies and TV-shows</title><description><![CDATA[
<p><em>Sentence mining</em> is the process of picking sentences from your immersion and making Anki cards.
Each sentence has one unknown piece of information,
which is referred to as <em>target word</em>.</p>
<p>To mine sentences from movies and TV-shows
you are going to need the mpv video player,
and a plugin for mpv called mpvacious.</p>
