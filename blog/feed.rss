<title>Are there potential downsides of using audio-only content like podcasts as the main source of free-flow immersion?</title>
<author>Tatsumoto</author>
<description><![CDATA[<p>There's really no need to confine yourself to audio-only content,
such as podcasts,
for free-flow immersion,
as audio-visual content like movies and TV shows will be far more effective.</p>
<p>If you primarily learn through audio and visual materials,
you will develop strong listening skills.
This proficiency will be of great value in the long term.
If you acquire your target language through listening
before starting to read,
the way your brain will process the language
will be more in line with that of native speakers.
However, native speakers don't limit themselves to listening alone.
By excluding visual media you are lowering your comprehension for no reason at all.</p>
<p>Audio-visual content gives you all the benefits of audio-only content,
and your comprehension will be much higher thanks to the visual cues.
On the other hand,
podcasts can be difficult to understand,
particularly for beginner learners.
They lack transcripts,
visual context
and anything else that could help you understand what is being said.
In my experience, podcasts are virtually indistinguishable from white noise
until you reach a solid intermediate level.
So, there are huge downsides to
relying solely on audio-only content for free-flow immersion,
as it will drastically slow down vocabulary acquisition.
I would recommend audio-visual content instead.</p>
<p>I deem audio-only free-flow immersion to be comparable to passive immersion.
It is unlikely that during listening one can maintain the same
level of focus and attention as when watching.
While it is acceptable to use podcasts for passive immersion,
as long as you understand the language used,
it is advisable to choose a medium that you have previously watched actively.</p>
<p>The rate of acquisition also depends on what you do during intensive immersion.
If during intensive immersion you read novels, comic books, or watch movies and TV shows,
while looking up words and mining sentences, then you will be learning vocabulary faster,
and the downsides of using audio-only content during free-flow immersion will be less significant.</p>

<title>Setting up GoldenDict</title>
<author>Tatsumoto</author>
<description><![CDATA[<p>GoldenDict is a libre dictionary application for GNU/Linux and other OSes.
Like <a href="setting-up-qolibri.html">Qolibri</a>, it lets you search multiple dictionaries at the same time
so for every word you look up you immediately get a number of definitions.
GoldenDict is a great tool for language learners,
and it becomes especially helpful
when one switches from bilingual dictionaries to monolingual dictionaries.
It can aid during the monolingual transition
thanks to the ability to look up many words at once in separate tabs,
simplifying recursive look-ups.</p>

<title>Passive immersion</title>
<author>Tatsumoto</author>
<description><![CDATA[<p>When we talk about immersion, we usually divide it into active and passive.
<em>Active immersion</em> requires full attention to the content
and can be practiced through reading and watching content in the target language.
<em>Passive immersion</em> means listening to the language while engaging in other activities.
When listening passively you're not fully focused on the content,
instead you're doing something else
while having the speech in your target language play in the background.</p>

<title>Active immersion</title>
<author>Tatsumoto</author>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Active immersion is a crucial part of language learning
and requires full attention to the content you are consuming.
In this article,
we will look in more detail at what active immersion is and how to practice it.
We will also discuss the different types of active immersion,
and how to deal with the ambiguity that can arise when immersing.</p>

<title>Reading books</title>
<author>Tatsumoto</author>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Reading a book is a simple process.
You don't need much technology to read a book.
In contrast,
when watching a movie,
you need software that can create Anki cards from the subtitles.
Or,
when reading manga,
you need an OCR tool to extract text from the images.
But to read a book, all you may need is
a dictionary on hand to look up unfamiliar words.
And a program that can open and display books, of course.
If you have a paper book, you don't even need a computer.
Nevertheless, there are some tips I'd like to discuss here.</p>
<p>In this article, we'll discuss a few tips and tricks to help make
reading books in Japanese easier and more enjoyable.</p>

<title>Luke Smith says that you will not learn a language by consuming media. Doesn't it contradict the AJATT theory?</title>
<author>Tatsumoto</author>
<description><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p>There's this lazy idea that somehow if you passively sit around and watch
people using a language this will somehow endow you with the ability to
flexibly produce a language in the same way you see others using it. People
want to believe it because they want to be able to watch TV or play a cell
phone game like Duolingo or valueless Rosetta Stone-like software and somehow
gain competence in a language.</p>
<p>It's not going to happen ever. Learning to play a boring computer game using
words from a different language is not the same as learning to speak the
language.</p>
<p>You might say of &quot;just listening to speech&quot; that &quot;that's what children do,&quot; but
that's not true at all. Children try pretty hard to participate and understand
conversation. They sometimes have a desperate personal need to understand each
passing sentence and hear the language they are trying to learn for hours a day
for years. You watching some forgettable movie in the background as you play
with your phone don't.</p>
<p><em>— <a href="https://lukesmith.xyz/articles/notes-on-learning-languages/">Notes on Learning Languages - Luke Smith</a></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We talk about <a href="whats-immersion.html">input and immersion</a> a lot on this site.
But the most important point to take away is that
the input should be at least somewhat <a href="what-is-comprehensible-input.html">comprehensible</a>
and active attempts should be constantly made
to make the unknown bits more comprehensible.
If you just sit around watching something that you don't understand at all,
don't expect to gain any competence in the language.</p>

<title>When reviewing cards, if I could only remember a word due to the surrounding context, how should I grade the card?</title>
<author>Tatsumoto</author>
<description><![CDATA[<p>This means that you've formed a <a href="discussing-various-card-templates.html#pros-and-cons-of-sentence-cards">context-dependent memory</a>.
Context-dependent memories can form no matter what card template you're using,
including word cards,
since no context is a type of context in itself.
If you find that you can't remember a particular word on an Anki card,
and you are only able to understand it due to the context of the sentence,
it implies that the card is not meeting its intended purpose
of helping you recognize and comprehend the word.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is no quick fix for context-dependent memories.
It takes time and exposure to the word in various contexts to fully acquire it.
If the card isn't fulfilling its intended purpose,
failing it or grading it good will not make any difference.
After you've successfully identified that the card is not helping you,
the best course of action is to modify the card by either swapping the sentence with another
one or converting it to a word card when applicable.
An argument against this would be the time it takes to edit the card,
but it's probably not that difficult and time-consuming these days
since with <a href="plumbing-for-language-learners.html">cabl</a> you have example sentences at your fingertips.</p>
<p>The final decision is up to you.
Personally,
I prefer not to fail the card since relearning it won't correct the flawed memory.
Instead, I do one or the combination of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Swap the card with a different card with the same target word.</li>
<li>Introduce a second card with the same target word (there's <a href="sentence-mining.html#many-cards-for-one-word">a caveat</a> though).</li>
<li>Edit the card and swap the sentence.</li>
<li>Do nothing, just proceed with my reviews and hope to eventually learn the word properly through immersion.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you believe that failing the card will be beneficial in some way,
then there is fundamentally nothing wrong with that.
However, should you continue to fail it, the card will eventually become a leech.
If Anki suspends the card,
you need to create a new one with the same target word but a different sentence.</p>

<title>Should I watch with Japanese subtitles while going through the kanji phase?</title>
<author>Tatsumoto</author>
<description><![CDATA[<p>It is not a bad idea to watch with Japanese subtitles
while progressing through the <a href="learning-kanji.html">kanji phase</a> (JP1K or isolated kanji).
Doing so can improve motivation and further increase your learning rate
as it provides opportunities to practice the knowledge gained from studying kanji
in a different context than <a href="spaced-repetition.html">SRS</a> cards.</p>
<p>However,
I think one <a href="is-it-harmful-to-always-have-tl-subtitles-on.html">must be careful</a>
when watching with Japanese subtitles as a beginner.
It should not constitute the majority of your immersion,
as the focus should be on building listening skills.
Watching with subtitles is more akin to reading than listening,
and premature reading negatively affects one's ability to perceive sounds and understand spoken language.
So you have to be really moderate about it,
maybe keep it to less than one third of all your active immersion.</p>
<p>Subtitles can be of help no matter what stage in the process of learning Japanese you are at,
but it is also important to spend a lot of time without them.
Watching with subtitles is acceptable
as long as you regularly train your listening ability as well.</p>

<title>Is it important to practice reading tategaki?</title>
<author>Tatsumoto</author>
<description><![CDATA[<p>No, you don't have to practice reading tategaki.</p>
<p>In Japanese, the term tategaki (<code>縦書き</code>) is used to describe text written vertically.
This style of writing is read from top to bottom, then right to left,
and was traditionally the standard for Japanese writing.
However, in modern times,
horizontal writing is more common due to the prevalence of the internet and other digital media.
Modern Japanese people often read both horizontal and vertical text.</p>
<p>You don't have to go out of your way and practice reading text written vertically.
It is not something to be overly concerned about.
As someone learning Japanese,
it is unavoidable to come across vertical text,
just like it's hard to avoid reading text with kanji.
So as long as your <a href="whats-immersion.html">immersion</a> is balanced,
and you regularly read manga or light novels, you're set.
In light novels and manga text is always vertical, maybe with some exceptions.</p>
<p>If you only read on a computer screen,
it is possible that the program you are using to read books shows the text horizontally
and does not support tategaki.
If so, don't worry about it too much,
as manga alone will still provide you with sufficient
practice to become proficient in reading tategaki.</p>
<p>Reading tategaki is not difficult.
I find that reading both vertical and horizontal Japanese is natural,
and there is no difference in terms of difficulty.
Even if you totally avoid media that has tategaki,
it is unlikely to have a major negative impact on your reading ability.
You still will be able to read vertical Japanese text,
much like you can read vertical English text.
Maybe your reading speed will be a bit slower,
but it's not something that trips people off.</p>
<p>Ultimately,
there are more important and challenging aspects of Japanese
that could benefit from focus and deliberate practice.</p>

<title>I'm not a kid anymore. Am I too old to learn a language?</title>
<author>Tatsumoto</author>
<description><![CDATA[<p>No matter your age,
it is never too late to learn a new language.
Research and anecdotal evidence have both proven that
adults can acquire languages similarly to how children do it.
In fact, adults aquire languages faster than babies.
The advantage of being an adult
is that we can use various tools and techniques to speed up the process,
such as the AJATT method,
which can typically help one become fluent in a language within just 2 years.
This is a far cry from a typical 4-year-old child who,
despite having been exposed to language input constantly,
still doesn't sound very good and still makes some mistakes.</p>
