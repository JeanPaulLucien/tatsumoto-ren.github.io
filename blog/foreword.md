# Foreword

Congratulations! You've taken your first step towards learning Japanese!

I'm Tatsumoto. I'm primarily known for a [Telegram channel](https://t.me/ajatt_tools)
with focus on helping foreigners learn Japanese language.

This site is a quickstart guide for the subscribers
and anyone who wants to learn Japanese solely through **self-study**.
We focus on understanding before speaking, or input before output.
We believe doing so is the shortest path to fluency,
because you avoid whole groups of problems that come with premature output,
such as foreign accent and grammar mistakes.
This approach makes the journey easy and fun
because from day one you are encouraged to learn from compelling content
made for native speakers of your target language.
Most people who persevered and reached fluency
watched their favorite TV shows in Japanese
and read lots of books and manga every day.
No amount of brute force can get you there,
so forget about traditional approaches such as taking classes or hiring a tutor.

****

Why classes suck.

* They cost money.
* They don't provide compelling content, they're boring.
* In class, you get *toxic input*,
you get to listen to speech produced by other foreigners which is ridden with mistakes.
* Your teacher doesn't know Japanese that well.
* If you happen to get a native as your teacher,
they likely have no idea how language acquisition works,
they don't remember how they learned Japanese,
and they've never actually followed their own advice.

We divide the process of learning any foreign language into two steps.

1) Learn to understand the language at a high level.
2) Use your understanding to learn to speak the language,
by mimicking native speakers.
This is similar to how kids do it.

The method explained here is widely known as
[AJATT](faq.html#whats-ajatt),
or All Japanese All the Time.
It is directed at people who want to get to fluency as fast as possible
by spending a lot of time with the language.
The key component to succeeding with AJATT is engaging with the language all the time,
going as hardcore as you can.

AJATT has very little formal structure.
You learn the most common words, study some basic grammar,
but after that you dive into authentic content.
You learn new things as they come up in the content.

The emphasis is very strong on input and comprehension in the beginning.
You try to get to understand Japanese perfectly
before concerning with trying to produce Japanese yourself.

Some things you find on the old AJATT site may differ with what I recommend here.
The core principles and theory behind the method never change,
but the way we practice AJATT tends to shift over time.
Many tools simply didn't exist at the time the AJATT site was written,
including giant ones like Yomichan, a browser add-on for looking up Japanese words
that virtually everyone uses today.

We use a variety of software to help in the learning process.
The tools introduced in this guide are
[free as in freedom](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html).
We don't endorse
[proprietary software](https://www.gnu.org/proprietary/proprietary.html)
and services that mistreat their users.

Money is a concern too.
I learned Japanese without spending any money, and I encourage you to do so too.
Everything you need to master Japanese can be found online,
including anime, manga, light novels and visual novels.
Dictionaries, grammar guides and software are also available in abundance.

Avoid *blue-pilled* resources.
There are a myriad of methods out there,
and each of them tells you to do different things.
Some methods are effective, but many are not.
Unfortunately, on the Internet there is much more bad advice than good.
If you want to reach mastery in a foreign language,
you don't want to waste you time on ineffective methods.

Examples of low quality resources.

* Textbooks made for foreigners.
Examples include Genki, Minna no Nihongo, Japanese From Zero, etc.
If your goal is proficiency, you won't be satisfied with the low level and slow pace of textbooks.
In the beginning you can use a basic grammar guide,
everything on top of that won't be necessary.
* Wanikani, Duolingo, Busuu and most "apps",
especially if they claim that you can learn to speak a language in 10 minutes a day.
Language apps can't replace learning through massive exposure to the target language,
and they can't tell you everything you should know.
Language is not an app that you open and close.
Reaching fluency is more like multi-booting,
i.e., installing multiple operating systems on a single computer,
and being able to choose which one to boot.
Each OS has to be completely operational,
you should be able to do anything you want with it.
The only real app you need is a flashcard application to review what you've learned.
* YouTube channels where everybody speaks English all the time, like JapanesePod101.
* Any method that doesn't put immersion first or forces premature speaking.

The next article will provide you with an overview of the method,
and the most important steps you need to take.
The remaining articles address each step in detail.
