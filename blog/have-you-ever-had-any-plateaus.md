I haven't.
You can't be stuck if you're doing AJATT,
but you can be stuck if you slack on your immersion.

I've had a feeling of not progressing,
which is what people call the plateau.
Almost everyone who has learned a foreign language had this feeling at some point in the process.
It didn't bother me.
I knew that I was actually improving because I trusted the AJATT method.
I knew that the solution is just to get more input, continue doing what I was doing.

It helps to always seek input that is slightly above your current level.
Let's say if you're a beginner, you watch slice of life anime and make tons of progress.
But if you continue watching slice of life anime later down the line,
you're not going to progress nearly as fast.
So maybe you need to switch to fantasy anime,
or read a light novel,
or watch a jdrama about something *hard* like lawyers, bankers or whatever.
