No.

Back in the day you could email Khatzumoto
and he would post your message on the AJATT site along with the reply.
He also used to do consultations with people, though they costed money.
But I was born too late for all of that.
By the time I started learning Japanese,
Khatzumoto was long gone from the Internet.
