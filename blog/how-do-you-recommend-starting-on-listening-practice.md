There's really not that much to it.

The way I learned to understand spoken Japanese is by watching raw anime.
If you're a fan of anime, you'll find this method enjoyable and engaging.
Anime is easy to understand
because it is voiced by professional voice actors who typically speak clearly
and use the standard Japanese dialect.
This ensures that you're learning from high-quality,
accurate sources of spoken Japanese.
Moreover,
anime covers a wide range of vocabulary,
including both formal and informal expressions.

But how do you make the most out of this practice? Here are some tips:

1) Watch an episode first without subtitles or translations.
   This helps you focus on the sounds of the language rather than relying on written cues.
1) After watching, read the Japanese subtitles and learn any unknown words.
   This expands your vocabulary
   and helps you notice the words when you hear them again later.
1) Extract the audio track and listen to it multiple times using [mpd](passive-listening.html#mpd).
   You will hear and notice the words you've learned recently.
   Repetition helps train your ear to distinguish individual sounds and patterns.

Mastering a language takes time and effort.
But as you continue to practice,
your listening abilities will improve and you'll be able to easily
comprehend more and more of what you hear.
