When I started AJATT, I was a full time university student, so it wasn't easy,
but I tried to immerse as much as possible.
I had earphones on in class and while commuting.
When I would finish my daily duties,
I would go back to living my life in Japanese.
I always kept the immersion going at home.
I spent all my free time doing something fun in Japanese.

The biggest thing I never did in Japanese was studying programming.
Even though you can read books about programming in you target language,
I think English is the only language where we have high quality programming resources.
All programming languages are essentially based on English.

And of course I would have to pause my immersion
when I would hang out with my friends who didn't care about Japanese.
