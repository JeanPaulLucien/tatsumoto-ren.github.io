1) Download or create a new note type.

   Any Anki deck you download from the internet comes with a Note Type.
   If the same Note Type does not exist in your Anki collection, it will be added.
   Our collection of Note Types can be found
   [on GitHub](https://github.com/Ajatt-Tools/AnkiNoteTypes).

   From the Anki main screen, go to "Tools" > "Manage Note Types".
   There you will see all the installed note types.
2) The process of converting notes to a different note type is not difficult.
   First make sure that you've imported the desired Note Type.
   Then open the Anki browser (shortcut: <kbd>b</kbd>) and select the notes you wish to convert.
   The whole deck can be selected by pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd>.
   Lastly, choose the option "Change Note Type" from the context menu
   or go to menu "Notes" > "Change Note Type..." (shortcut: <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>M</kbd>).
   The rest is a matter of mapping the right fields and pressing `OK`.
