Unless you're a schizo, you shouldn't think about it at all.

One thing I can say is that
if you want to learn how to be a nice person in another language,
how to fit in the society,
how to be funny,
how to make a good impression on new people,
etc.,
you first have to learn what people in the country like,
how they interact with each other.
You learn that through lots of immersion
and through observing and paying attention to natives.
