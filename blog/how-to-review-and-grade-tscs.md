[TSCs](discussing-various-card-templates.html#targeted-sentence-cards) are very flexible in how you can review them.

When you learn a card for the first time,
read the full sentence and understand its meaning as a whole,
as well as meanings of individual words in isolation.

When you review the card later,
you can choose not to read the whole sentence
and instead only read the target word.
Read the word then reveal the back of the card and read the definition.

Pass the card if you understand the meaning and reading of the target word.
A definition is just one of many possible ways to describe the word.
Don't recall the definition in case of a monolingual card,
or the translation in case of a bilingual card verbatim.
Having a general idea of the meaning in your head is enough.
If the word has more than one meaning,
don't recall all its definitions.
Focus on the context of the TSC in question to determine what definition you are tested on.
