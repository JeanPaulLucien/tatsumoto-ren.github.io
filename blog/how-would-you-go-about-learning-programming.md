* Read books about programming.
* Get a degree.
* Study the code others wrote.
* Make Anki cards for questions and snippets you often look up.
  For example, "how to shuffle a list in Python".
* Write programs you would use yourself, and learn how to do it in the process.
  Since this site is mostly about language learning,
  you could make a program that helps people learn languages.
