<p>3000 Essential Vocabulary for the JLPT N1,
also known as JLPT Tango N1,
is a textbook to prepare for the JLPT N1.
It contains ~2000 Japanese sentences and their English translations.
The book includes vocabulary found commonly on the JLPT and often used in everyday life.</p>
<p>With the help of our chat members,
we have created an Anki deck from
sentences listed in the book
and native audio that comes with it.</p>

<p>YouTube is a popular website where people can upload and watch videos.
Through watching YouTube you can immerse with native Japanese content.
Such content can be of particular interest to people
who want to understand colloquial Japanese,
speech with a lot of mumbling, slurs and slang.
There are many language-dense streams and podcasts on YouTube
that can be used for background listening.
You can also find news channels with more formal speech.</p>

<p>A typical entry in a monolingual dictionary looks similar to this:</p>
<pre><code>あした [3] 【明日・朝】 （名）
（１）今日の次の日。
（２）夜が終わって，明るくなった時。あさ。
</code></pre>
<p>Every dictionary usually has its own, unique system of notation.
On this page I primarily use <code>大辞泉</code> as an example.
If you need help finding monolingual dictionaries, see the

<p>Ever wondered how Japanese people type?
No one knows the answer.
Some people say that they use huge keyboards with hundreds of keys like on the picture.
Luckily for us, we don't have to imitate Japanese people and buy a keyboard like that.
There are programs called <strong>Input Method Editors</strong> (IMEs)
that help us do the same thing on a regular computer keyboard.
With an IME you type Latin letters
and the software automatically converts them to Japanese characters.</p>
<p>Typing words in a dictionary,
searching the web
or talking to people who pretend to be Japanese on the Internet
all require being able to input Japanese characters.
If you're serious about learning Japanese,
you need to learn how to do it.</p>

<!-- bashblog_timestamp: #1638303348# -->
<div class="subtitle">November 30, 2021 &mdash; Tatsumoto</div>
<!-- text begin -->
<p><strong>Sentence mining</strong> is a process of extracting sentences
that contain unknown words
from the content you read, watch or listen to in your target language
and adding them to Anki in a form of targeted sentence cards (TSCs).
You put an example sentence in the question field
and the definitions, pictures and pronunciations in the answer field.</p>
<p>Sentence mining and immersion are the two most important components of our method.
Immersion provides you with new vocabulary to be mined,
and mined sentences become fuel that advances your language learning.</p>
<p>Finding your own sentences is much more fun than learning from a premade deck,
or, god forbid, a textbook.
Because you're creating Anki cards out of vocabulary found in your immersion,
you're always learning what is relevant to you.
Once you reach this stage, it is way harder to quit Japanese,
as the foundation is already in place.</p>

<p>Japanese subtitles can be found in
<a href="resources.html#japanese-subtitles">many places</a>.
Often after downloading an archive with subtitles for your show
you find that the subtitles are not in sync with the video files you have on your computer.
In this article let's discuss what you can do to sync them.</p>
