I'm guessing that's a joke.
JAV has extremely poor language density.
If you watch JAV, skip all the parts where no one's talking.

If you like erotic content, I recommend reading doujinshi,
maybe something from Nhentai or a similar site.
In them you see lots of dialogues
They're better for immersion.
