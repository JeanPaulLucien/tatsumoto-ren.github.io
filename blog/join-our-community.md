## Our principles

* **No proprietary software.**
We use free/libre software because
it is naturally more extensible and user-friendly.
We don't use, support or recommend
[proprietary software](https://www.gnu.org/proprietary/),
such as Windows or macOS.
We especially are not going to endorse proprietary services
that have gone out of their way to spy on their users, such as
[Discord](how-to-save-the-japanese-learning-community.html).
	* [Our immersion learning toolset](our-immersion-learning-toolset.html)
	* [Communication software](https://web.archive.org/web/https://wiki.installgentoo.com/wiki/Communication#Synchronous_Communication_.28Real_time.29)
* **Speak English or Japanese only.**
Both English and Japanese (but nothing else) are allowed.
Refrain from chatting in a language that most participants won't understand.
* **Be ethical.**
Do not post promotions or spam unrelated to learning Japanese.
However, feel free to share with us your learning resources.
Be minimally polite, don't troll, and don't post porn.
* **Stay on topic.**
Try to keep the conversation centered around
immersion, software for language learning,
Japanese language, the country and its culture.
Everything else should be discussed in the room dedicated to off-topic.
* **Freedom of speech.**
We value the right to say whatever one wants,
so we rarely ban people from our rooms.
However, don't abuse it, or you might become one of the few.

## Matrix

[Matrix](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Matrix)
is great because it's completely libre and federated,
and you don't need an email address, or a phone number to make an account.
Just type your name and a password, and you're in!
Before you join, install a
[Matrix client](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/List_of_applications/Internet#Matrix_clients)
and register an account on
[any server](list-of-matrix-servers.html)
that is **not** matrix.org.

</p>

Alternatively, use a
[web app](https://nerdsin.space/#/room/#djt:midov.pl)
or open your client and type `/join #djt:midov.pl`.

## Telegram

[Telegram](https://telegram.org/)
is a messenger with a focus on speed and security.
Although Telegram
[is not ideal](https://spyware.neocities.org/articles/telegram.html)
it is still better than many proprietary services.
To use Telegram on GNU/Linux, install
[the official desktop client](https://archlinux.org/packages/?name=telegram-desktop).

## Questions

If you have a question specifically for me,
ping me in the chat by prepending your message with
`@tatsumoto:g33k.se` on Matrix or `@tatsumoto` on Telegram.

## Community stickers

If you're a Telegram user, installing
[our community sticker pack](https://t.me/addstickers/ajatt)
is easy, you just click on the link.
On Matrix, it's a little more tricky.
You need to host your stickers yourself.
See the
[stickerpicker](https://github.com/maunium/stickerpicker)
GitHub repo and
[this video](https://youtu.be/Yz3H6KJTEI0)
for detailed instructions.
To use our Telegram stickers on Matrix,
import them to your self-hosted repo using the `sticker-import` command
or copy the URL of
[the pack I host for myself](https://tatsumoto-ren.github.io/stickerpicker/web/).
To add the sticker pack to your Matrix account, follow the instructions
[here](https://github.com/maunium/stickerpicker/wiki/Enabling-the-widget).
