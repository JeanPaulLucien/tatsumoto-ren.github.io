# Join our community

Daily Japanese Thread is a friendly place
for people learning Japanese through immersion.
Join us to make friends, get help, ask questions,
contribute to our [projects](https://github.com/Ajatt-Tools)
and find countless new learning resources!

You can join us on Matrix or on Telegram.
Both platforms are connected with a bridge.

## Rules

1) **Speak English.**
Do not use your Japanese unless you're already fluent.
Remember that [talking is not practicing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiTsduRreug&t=352s).
Your time is better spent immersing.
1) **Be ethical.**
Do not post promotions or spam unrelated to learning Japanese.
However, feel free to share with us your learning resources.
Be minimally polite, don't troll and don't post porn.
1) **Stay on topic.**
Try to keep the conversation centered around
immersion, software for language learning,
Japanese language, the country and its culture.
Everything else should be discussed in the room dedicated to off-topic
which you'll find after you've joined.
1) **Read the guide.**
Most questions we get are already answered in [our guide](table-of-contents.html).
Our members are volunteering their time to help everybody.
Try to reduce the amount of reoccurring questions so that everyone has more time to immerse.
1) **No proprietary software.**
We don't use, support or recommend
[proprietary software](https://www.gnu.org/proprietary/).
We use
[free/libre software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html)
because it is naturally more extensible and user-friendly.

	* [Communication software](https://web.archive.org/web/https://wiki.installgentoo.com/wiki/Communication#Synchronous_Communication_.28Real_time.29)

*Certain rooms may have their own sets of rules.*

## Matrix

[Matrix](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Matrix)
is great because it's completely libre and federated,
and you don't need an email address, or a phone number to make an account.
Just type your name and a password, and you're in!
Before you join, install a
[Matrix client](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/List_of_applications/Internet#Matrix_clients)
and register an account on
[any server](list-of-matrix-servers.html)
that is **not** matrix.org.

</p>

If the button above doesn't work,
most likely you don't have
[Element](https://archlinux.org/packages/community/x86_64/element-desktop/)
installed on your computer.
Alternatively, use a
[web app](https://matrix.3dns.eu/#/room/#djt:midov.pl)
([another](https://webchat.kde.org/#/room/#djt:midov.pl))
or open your client of choice and type `/join #djt:midov.pl`.
Commands that start with `/` work in most clients, including Element.

## Telegram

[Telegram](https://telegram.org/)
is a messenger with a focus on speed and security.
Although Telegram
[is not ideal](https://spyware.neocities.org/articles/telegram.html)
it is still better than many proprietary services.
To use Telegram on GNU/Linux, install
[the official desktop client](https://archlinux.org/packages/?name=telegram-desktop).

## Questions

If you have a question specifically for me,
ping me in the chat by prepending your message with
`@tatsumoto:g33k.se` on Matrix or `@tatsumoto` on Telegram.

## Community stickers

If you're a Telegram user, installing
[our community sticker pack](https://t.me/addstickers/ajatt)
is easy, you just click on the link.
On Matrix, it's a little more tricky.
You need to host your stickers yourself.
See the
[stickerpicker](https://github.com/maunium/stickerpicker)
GitHub repo and
[this video](https://youtu.be/Yz3H6KJTEI0)
for detailed instructions.
To use our Telegram stickers on Matrix,
import them to your self-hosted repo using the `sticker-import` command
or copy the URL of
[the pack I host for myself](https://tatsumoto-ren.github.io/stickerpicker/web/).
To add the sticker pack to your Matrix account, follow the instructions
[here](https://github.com/maunium/stickerpicker/wiki/Enabling-the-widget).
