title: As a beginner learning Japanese through anime, should I lower the speed to hear the words better or should I leave it at normal speed?

Audio recordings become robotic and distorted when you lower the speed,
but in some corner cases it helps catch a word you would otherwise not hear.

Surprisingly, increasing volume helps too,
but you also should only use it for specific words instead of a whole recording.

The key takeaway is that if you always immerse while slowed down,
you're not inputting real, authentic Japanese.
While doing AJATT we practice understanding native speech as it appears in real life situations.
We have to practice as we play.
