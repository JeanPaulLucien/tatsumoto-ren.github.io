At
[Ajatt Tools](https://github.com/Ajatt-Tools)
we're developing tools to help you connect with another language.
We hope that they and other
[libre](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html)
projects developed by the community will help you in your language learning journey.

****

## [GNU/Linux](https://www.gnu.org/gnu/about-gnu.html)

GNU/Linux is a suitable replacement for
[Windows](https://www.gnu.org/proprietary/malware-microsoft.html)
or
[MacOS](https://www.gnu.org/proprietary/malware-apple.html).
An Arch-based distro is recommended.
If you've ever used a Debian-based distro, you know how slow the package manager is.
On the other hand, the package manager used in Arch-based distros
is one of the fastest package managers out there.

**Possible options:**
* [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/) - the default installation is very minimal,
installation steps have to be executed manually.
* [Manjaro](https://manjaro.org/) - aims to be user-friendly and offers lots of goodies out of the box.
* [Parabola](https://www.parabola.nu/) - a fully free/libre equivalent of Arch Linux.
* [Hyperbola](https://www.hyperbola.info/) - a distro that aims to be stable and secure,
as well as fully free/libre.
* [Artix](https://artixlinux.org/) - Arch Linux without systemd.

**Alternatives suggested by our members:**

* [NixOS](https://nixos.org/)
* [GuixSD](https://guix.gnu.org/)
* [Gentoo](https://www.gentoo.org/)

## [Anki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Anki)

Create, manage and review flashcards
to remember the words, phrases, and grammar points
you've studied.

and make Anki flashcards with a single click.

## [mpvacious](https://github.com/Ajatt-Tools/mpvacious)

Make instant Anki cards from movies and TV shows.

* [AUR package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/mpv-mpvacious/)

## [impd](https://github.com/Ajatt-Tools/impd)

Passive listening is one of the key components of the AJATT method,
so it is useful to make it as convenient as possible.
`impd` is a small tool for managing background immersion.
Create condensed audio,
automatically add episodes of TV shows you've watched to your
[mpd](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Music_Player_Daemon)
playlist,
and archive audio that you've listened to enough times.

* [AUR package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/impd-git/)
* [Passive immersion guide](passive-listening.html)

## [qolibri](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/qolibri/)

A QT-based EPWING dictionary viewer.
qolibri lets you search multiple EPWING dictionaries at the same time,
so for any word you look up you get a list of different definitions.
Since using a Japanese to Japanese dictionary can be difficult for beginners
being able to see one word described in multiple ways makes it easier
to understand what it really means.

* [Setup guide](setting-up-qolibri.html)
* [Dictionaries](yomichan-and-epwing-dictionaries.html)

* [AUR package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/ames/)

## [subs2srs](http://subs2srs.sourceforge.net/)

A small utility that allows you to mass-generate Anki decks
based on your favorite foreign language movies and TV shows
to aid in the language learning process.

* [AUR package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/subs2srs/)
