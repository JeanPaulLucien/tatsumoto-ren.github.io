There are two rules of passive immersion.
First says to **listen to familiar content**.
The passive immersion playlist
should contain language-dense material that you've actively consumed before.
If you listen to something that you've never interacted with before,
it can be hard to keep up with it and understand it,
especially when you're not that fluent yet.
Intermediate learners may include podcasts in the mix.
The second rule says to **rotate immersion content**.
If you listen to something for too long,
it gets boring,
so you need to remove old content from the playlist and add something new.

After I watch an anime episode or a movie,
I add it to Immersion Pod.
I shuffle the episodes I've added and listen to them as passive immersion.
After an episode gets `10` days old, I remove it from the playlist.
[impd](passive-listening.html#impd) does all of this automatically for me.
