## Examples and pronunciations

Sometimes you might find yourself in a situation where
you want to add a word to your SRS
but the example sentence you've found the word in is too complicated
or you've lost it because you forgot to save it.
In such cases sites with example sentences come to rescue.

Many of them come from non-native speakers.

	In **Preferences**, set "When a word is selected" to "Copy"

is known for spying on and politically suppressing its users.
* Contains outdated information.
* Talks about MCD, which is a flashcard format that hasn't received much adoption
over the years due to being too difficult and complicated.
* Advertises unnecessary paid products.
* Tries to harvest Email addresses.

### [Refold](https://refold.la/)

This site was initially introduced as a free guide
designed to be applicable to any language.
Later proved to be a Patreon scam,
but there are some helpful articles you can read without paying money.

Notable articles:

* [Tolerate the Ambiguity](https://web.archive.org/web/20210318233119/https://refold.la/roadmap/stage-0/b/tolerate-ambiguity/)
* [Basic Sentence Mining](https://web.archive.org/web/20210702022836/https://refold.la/roadmap/stage-2/a/basic-sentence-mining/)
* [Basic Anki Setup](https://web.archive.org/web/20210429222205/https://refold.la/roadmap/stage-1/a/anki-setup/)
* [Grammar](https://web.archive.org/web/20210308092625/https://refold.la/roadmap/stage-1/c/grammar/)

Anti-features:

* The site doesn't work (the menu breaks) unless you enable JavaScript.
The JavaScript code is proprietary and is not safe to run.
* Recommends and includes links to proprietary spyware
such as Hellotalk, Tandem, Bilingua, Netflix, Migaku, etc.
* Includes instructions on how to join their Discord server.
Discord is known for spying on and politically suppressing its users.
* Collects Email addresses which is to say the least suspicious.
* Tries to sell you useless junk.

### [Itazuraneko](https://itazuraneko.neocities.org/)

A collection of guides for those interested in learning Japanese.

Anti-features:

* Includes links to nonfree software.
* Includes links to Discord servers.
Discord is known for spying on and politically suppressing its users.
* Contains outdated information.

### [Antimoon](http://www.antimoon.com/)

A site on how to learn English.
Made by Poles who learned English to native-level fluency.
What they used to learn English can be applied for learning any other language, including Japanese.

Notable articles:

* [Sentence cards](http://www.antimoon.com/how/usingsm-makeitems-sentence.htm)
* [Example sentence cards](http://www.antimoon.com/how/examplesent.htm)

### [TheMoeWay](https://learnjapanese.moe/) and [AnimeCards](https://animecards.site/)

Unfortunately, these two sites are clearly made with
[Windows](https://www.gnu.org/proprietary/malware-microsoft.html)
users in mind,
but maybe you'll find useful language learning advice there.

Anti-features:

* The sites try to deny the importance of freedom and legitimize proprietary software.
* They include instructions for
[playing visual novels](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/nonfree-games.html).
Most visual novels should be avoided since they are proprietary.
* They mention software that requires proprietary operating systems to run.
* They include links to Discord servers.
[Discord](how-to-save-the-japanese-learning-community.html)
is known for spying on and politically suppressing its users.
* Both sites recommend "anime cards".
In my opinion, TSC is the most efficient way to combine Anki with immersion.
