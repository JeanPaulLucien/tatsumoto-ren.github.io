or you've lost it because you forgot to save it.

Storing immersion material locally makes mining substantially easier.

A torrent site with anime, manga, light novels and Japanese dramas.
Contains 98% of what you need to actually learn Japanese.

	Unfortunately, Nyaa is blocked in some countries,

One of the many methods of learning kanji.
* [10,000 Sentences: How](http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/10000-sentences-how/).
The sentence mining method Khatzumoto used for learning Japanese.
* [On Grammar](http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/on-grammar).

Anti-features:

* Includes links to the Amazon website.
[Amazon](https://stallman.org/amazon.html)
is known for spying on and politically suppressing its users.
* Contains outdated information.
* Talks about MCD, which is a flashcard format that hasn't received much adoption
over the years due to being too difficult and complicated.
* Advertises unnecessary paid products.

### [Refold](https://refold.la/)

A site founded by a successful ajatter after becoming fluent.
The method is designed to be applicable to any language.

Notable articles:
* [Tolerate the Ambiguity](https://web.archive.org/web/20210318233119/https://refold.la/roadmap/stage-0/b/tolerate-ambiguity/)
* [Basic Sentence Mining](https://web.archive.org/web/20210702022836/https://refold.la/roadmap/stage-2/a/basic-sentence-mining/)

* [Grammar](https://web.archive.org/web/20210308092625/https://refold.la/roadmap/stage-1/c/grammar/)

Anti-features:

* The site doesn't work (the menu breaks) unless you enable JavaScript.
* Recommends and includes links to proprietary spyware
such as Hellotalk, Tandem, Bilingua, Netflix, Migaku, etc.
* Includes instructions on how to join their Discord server.
Discord is known for spying on and politically suppressing its users.
* Collects Email addresses which is to say the least suspicious.

### [Itazuraneko](https://itazuraneko.neocities.org/)

A collection of guides for those interested in learning Japanese.

Anti-features:

* Includes links to nonfree software.
* Includes links to Discord servers.
Discord is known for spying on and politically suppressing its users.
* Contains outdated information.

### [Antimoon](http://www.antimoon.com/)

A site on how to learn English.

What they used to learn English can be applied for learning any other language, including Japanese.

Notable articles:

* [Sentence cards](http://www.antimoon.com/how/usingsm-makeitems-sentence.htm)
* [Example sentence cards](http://www.antimoon.com/how/examplesent.htm)

### [TheMoeWay](https://learnjapanese.moe/) and [AnimeCards](https://animecards.site/)

Unfortunately, these two sites are clearly made with
[Windows](https://www.gnu.org/proprietary/malware-microsoft.html)
users in mind,
but maybe you'll find useful language learning advice there.

Anti-features:

* The sites try to deny the importance of freedom and legitimize proprietary software.
* They include instructions for
[playing visual novels](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/nonfree-games.html).
Most visual novels should be avoided since they are proprietary.
* They mention software that requires proprietary operating systems to run.
* They include links to Discord servers.
[Discord](how-to-save-the-japanese-learning-community.html)
is known for spying on and politically suppressing its users.
* Both sites recommend "anime cards".
In my opinion, TSC is the most efficient way to combine Anki with immersion.

## Misc

* [Immersion Wiki](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gDpwFl07a0EO_pTHLLVn_Waz2GXwwSE1)
