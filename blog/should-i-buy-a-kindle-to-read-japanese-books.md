No, please!
If you already have one, get rid of it.
Amazon Swindle is a malicious device designed to handcuff you.

There are good software alternatives for reading books [listed here](resources.html#reading-ebooks).
If you need a physical device,
obtain one running [GNU/Linux](our-immersion-learning-toolset.html#gnu-linux)
or [Android](our-immersion-learning-toolset.html#android).
