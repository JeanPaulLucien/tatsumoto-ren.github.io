No. Mine as many as you want.

If, for example, you find a long anime that you like, mine from it.
It's totally fine as long as you're having fun and keep finding 1T sentences.

In the long run you may reach a point
where you have mined most vocabulary that is often used in that particular source.
If it happens, you won't be able to mine enough sentences each day.
In my experience it's unlikely to happen,
but if it happens,
you want to limit the amount of time you immerse with it.
Find something new to immerse with and mine.
