No.

Making mnemonics for every word takes too much time.
Recalling the mnemonics also takes additional time.
In addition, you want to have a short connection between a word and its meaning in your head.
A mnemonic would just stay in the way.

It may be hard to remember new words in the beginning.
If you can't remember a card after a few tries,
let [Mortician](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1255924302) bury it for you.
Bury or suspend difficult cards to learn more easier cards.
