If you're interested in Khatzumoto's original ideas,
you may want to read the AJATT site.
It can help you answer some language learning questions you have.

First make sure you've read [our guide](table-of-contents.html).
There are ideas in which this site disagrees with the original AJATT method.
I want you to become aware of the new approach before you learn about the old ways.

Once you're ready, read the
[AJATT Table of Contents](https://web.archive.org/web/20220506045940/http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/all-japanese-all-the-time-ajatt-how-to-learn-japanese-on-your-own-having-fun-and-to-fluency/).
You can ignore everything outside the Table of Contents.
I also recommend exploring
[the old version](https://web.archive.org/web/20080828035044/http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/all-japanese-all-the-time-ajatt-how-to-learn-japanese-on-your-own-having-fun-and-to-fluency).

Honestly, today the AJATT site is a mess.
Although AJATT began as a free blog,
these days the site's homepage and many articles
contain nothing but ads for Khatzumoto's language learning products.
They are frankly just useless junk of questionable quality.
Don't enter your Email address and don't buy the paid products,
there are free alternatives.
