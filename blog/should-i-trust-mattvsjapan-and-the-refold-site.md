Mattvsjapan wants you to pay money for his courses and paywalled content.
This radically contradicts the core idea of this site,
which is to learn a language without spending any money at all.

If you want to watch his channel,
stick to the videos he published before around mid 2018,
he seems to be quite honest in them.
The old videos were inspired by AJATT and taught a lot of good things.
Unfortunately,
it is hard to find them today.
Many of the videos are not available on YouTube anymore.

In recent years Matt has been criticized
for watering down the method
and making it less effective.
On this site we try to stick to the spirit of AJATT,
so I recommend getting yourself familiar with the AJATT theory
before you explore content from Refold.
It will help you **distinguish** good advice from bad advice.
