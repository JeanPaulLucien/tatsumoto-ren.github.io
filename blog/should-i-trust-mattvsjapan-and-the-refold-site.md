Mattvsjapan wants you to pay money for his courses and paywalled content.
This radically contradicts the core idea of this site,
which is to learn a language without spending any money at all.

If you want to watch his channel,
stick to the videos he published before around mid 2018,
he seems to be quite honest in them.
The old videos were inspired by AJATT and taught a lot of good things.
Unfortunately,
it is hard to find them today.
Many of the videos are not available on YouTube anymore.

In recent years Matt has been criticized
for watering down his method
and making it less effective.
On this site we try to stick to the spirit of AJATT,
so I recommend getting yourself familiar with the AJATT theory
before you explore his content.
It will help you **distinguish** good advice from bad advice.

Refold in particular is just another scam site
designed to lure as many people as possible and turn them into paypigs.
You can tell by visiting its home page.

* Tries to sell you shitty courses, coaching, and even cups and glasses.
* Collects Email addresses and wants you to create an acccount which is to say the least suspicious.
* The site contains malicious nonfree JavaScript code which is not safe to run.
* Recommends and includes links to proprietary spyware
  such as Hellotalk, Tandem, Bilingua, Netflix, Migaku, etc.
* Includes instructions on how to join their
  [Discord](https://spyware.neocities.org/articles/discord.html) server.
  Discord is known for spying on and politically suppressing its users.

Learning languages is and always will be free.
