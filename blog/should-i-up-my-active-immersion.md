Yes, not only active.

What is your goal?
If you want to progress as quickly as most ajatters and reach fluency in under 2 years,
you should always aim at 12 to 18 hours of total immersion per day, as the AJATT site says.

After you've been ajatting for 18 months,
you can end your "hardcore phase" and start doing less immersion.
However, many choose to continue their hardcore phases until up to several years.

If your goal is to reach fluency in a longer period of time,
5 or even 10 years,
then you probably don't have to up your immersion.
