Yes, for concrete nouns on your [SWCs](discussing-various-card-templates.html#simple-word-cards).
You don't have to replace English definitions completely,
but it's very helpful to put a picture on the card
if it's a card for a concrete noun.

It's not that important for [TSCs](discussing-various-card-templates.html#targeted-sentence-cards).
Usually we make TSCs for words like adjectives and verbs.
They are quite difficult to describe with a picture alone.
