I wouldn't recommend that.
If you do RTK (lazy kanji or traditional), you'll have spent ~3 additional months on kanji.
That time is better spent practicing reading.
You're still in a very early stage.
Struggling with kanji is normal during this time.
If you haven't finished Tango N5 yet,
try the [JP1K method](learning-kanji.html#jp1k-method) instead of RTK.
It should help train kanji recognition
and teach you all words from the Tango N5 book at the same time.
If you have already finisehd Tango N5,
start watching anime with Japanese subtitles.
It's an easy an effective way to practice reading.
The audio will act as training wheels.
