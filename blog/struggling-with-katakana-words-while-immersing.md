Words commonly written in katakana,
including `和製英語` and `外来語`,
are annoying because you have to read katakana.
Due to the shapes of the characters,
reading katakana is more difficult,
especially long katakana-words.
Even Japanese people hate reading such words.

With training, you can get used to reading any alphabet,
but it's inevitable that a badly designed alphabet takes longer to adapt to.

Maybe one day Japan will switch to the Cyrillic script.
Until then, we have to deal with what we have.
