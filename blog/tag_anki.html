<div class="subtitle">February 25, 2021 &mdash; Tatsumoto</div>
<!-- text begin -->
<p>Recently <a href="https://refold.la/">Refold</a> proposed a new method of studying kanji
aimed at complete beginners who don't want to go through RTK.
If you want to learn more about the method from its author,
watch <a href="https://youtu.be/53qKsYxVhoM">this video</a>.</p>
<p><strong>WARNING:</strong> The resources above may contain links to software that AJT considers to be malicious.
We recommend making use of their language learning ideas
but disregarding their software recommendations.</p>
<p>In this article I'm going to be explaining the method
and the new Anki deck I made which I call AJT JP1K.</p>

<h1><a class="ablack" href="basic-vocabulary.html">Basic vocabulary</a></h1>

<div class="subtitle">January 31, 2021 &mdash; Tatsumoto</div>
<!-- text begin -->
<p>After finishing kanji, kana and essential grammar
the bulk of your AJATT journey will consist of learning vocabulary.
As the first step in this process
it makes sense to go through a basic vocabulary deck
containing the most frequent words in Japanese.
As before, you are going to use <a href="setting-up-anki.html">Anki</a> to do it.</p>
<p>Before diving in to full fledged immersion learning
memorizing the most frequently used 1 or 2 thousand words
is a great way to jumpstart your comprehension.
After that learning vocabulary from immersion becomes easier
because you'll at least be able to recognize the majority of words in a given sentence,
but you will still have to look up many words per page.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Card formats are differentiated by what you put on the front of the card.
This is the important part because it's what you are testing yourself on.
The back of the cards is much less important.
Its purpose is to help increase your understanding of what is on the front.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many learners agree that the most effective way to acquire Japanese
is to combine the SRS with immersion.
After finishing learning
<a href="learning-kana-in-two-days.html">kana</a> and <a href="jp1k-anki-deck.html">kanji</a>
you're going to continue to use Anki
in your study time to memorize sentence items.
The focus on sentences is very important. Your practice in Anki should mimic real world situations.
In other words, you should <em>practice how you play</em>.
And in real world we read sentences and we write sentences.
Having said that, word cards have their place in your SRS.
They are very effective for studying concrete nouns.</p>
<p>There are two major card templates that people tend to use: <code>sentence cards</code> and <code>word cards</code>.
Both have their variations depending on what information they contain on the back.</p>
<p>Regardless of the card template,
you create all your cards while consuming Japanese
using Yomichan, mpv scripts, qolibri and other software of your choice.
Avoid grinding premade decks beyond the absolute beginner stage,
but keep them in your sentence bank as a supplement
to find sentences when other sources fail you.</p>

<h1><a class="ablack" href="useful-anki-add-ons-for-japanese.html">Useful Anki add-ons for Japanese</a></h1>
<!-- bashblog_timestamp: #1609282554# -->
<div class="subtitle">December 30, 2020 &mdash; Tatsumoto</div>
<!-- text begin -->
<p>I often get asked in the chats what add-ons are recommended for learning Japanese.
mattvsjapan has a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy7GvwI7uV8">video</a> on this topic,
and although a few years have passed, surprisingly
there haven't been many new Anki add-ons worth recommending.
Below I'm going to mention add-ons from the video,
as well as add a few extra ones from myself.</p>

<h1><a class="ablack" href="setting-up-anki.html">Setting up Anki</a></h1>
<!-- bashblog_timestamp: #1609127492# -->
<div class="subtitle">December 28, 2020 &mdash; Tatsumoto</div>
<!-- text begin -->
<p><a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Anki">Anki</a>
is a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition">Spaced repetition</a>
system (SRS), a program which allows you to create, manage and review
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flashcard">flashcards</a>.</p>
<p>There are currently many different SRS’s available.
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Mnemosyne">Mnemosyne</a>
is considered to be a good Anki alternative.
However, I recommend that you stick with Anki.
It’s cross-platform, rich with features,
and supports <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/addons/">addons</a>, written in python.
There are many add-ons available that greatly aid language study, including a few of my own.
Because of the add-ons it's in my opinion really the only SRS application worth taking seriously.</p>
<p>What's most important, Anki is
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">libre software</a>
that respects the users'
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/https://wiki.installgentoo.com/wiki/Freedom">freedom</a>
and community.
Unlike Supermemo, for example. But you can't use that on GNU/Linux and Android anyway.</p>
<p>Many language learners find Anki useful to quickly memorize (frontload)
core vocabulary of their target language (TL),
as well as boost their learning in the later stages.</p>
<p>It should be noted, however, that memorization of most vocabulary throughout all your language
learning phases should be done by
<a href="https://refold.la/roadmap/stage-2/a/basic-sentence-mining#Mine-Sentences-Not-Words">studying sentences</a>.
You will be making vocabulary cards in the process as well,
but much less so, and mostly for nouns.</p>
<p>The only downside of Anki is that it can be <em>a little bit</em> difficult to learn how to use.
Depending on how you use it you can either greatly decrease your
time spent studying or make using Anki a living hell for yourself.
If you find yourself confused about how Anki works,
it is recommended that you read the <a href="https://docs.ankiweb.net/">Anki manual</a>.
However, because it's highly detailed and technical,
the bulk of this article will focus on explaining the most useful Anki settings
to help you get things up and running as quickly as possible.</p>
