<p>Congratulations! You've taken your first step towards learning Japanese!</p>
<p>I'm Tatsumoto. I'm primarily known for a <a href="https://t.me/ajatt_tools">Telegram channel</a>
with focus on helping foreigners learn Japanese language.</p>
<p>This site is a quickstart guide for the subscribers
and anyone who wants to build a solid understanding of the Japanese language.
We focus on understanding before speaking, or input before output.
We believe doing so is the shortest path to fluency,
because you avoid whole groups of problems that come with premature output,
such as foreign accent and grammar mistakes.
This approach makes the journey easy and fun
because from day one you are encouraged to learn from compelling content
made for native speakers of your target language.
Most people who persevered and reached fluency
watched their favorite TV shows in Japanese
and read lots of books and manga every day.
No amount of brute force can get you there,
so forget about traditional approaches such as taking classes or hiring a tutor.</p>

<div class="subtitle">April 24, 2021 &mdash; Tatsumoto</div>
<!-- text begin -->
<p><a href="https://foosoft.net/projects/yomichan/">Yomichan</a> is a browser extension
with a pop up dictionary
that allows you to look up unknown words with the hover of a mouse.
On top of that Yomichan can be set up to create Anki cards from the words which you look up.</p>
<p>The process of picking sentences from your immersion
and making Anki cards is called <em>sentence-mining</em> or <em>sentence-picking</em>.
Each mined sentence has to contain one unknown piece of information,
which is referred to as <em>target word</em>.</p>
<p>You don't necessarily have to pick an entire sentence,
but if you're a TSC user it is not necessary to keep mined items short.
When you're out in the wild picking sentences, select the ones that are interesting to you.
Your goal is not to mine every word.</p>

<h1><a class="ablack" href="passive-listening.html">Passive listening</a></h1>
<!-- bashblog_timestamp: #1618268880# -->
<div class="subtitle">April 13, 2021 &mdash; Tatsumoto</div>
<!-- text begin -->
<p>When we talk about immersion, we usually divide it into active and passive.
<em>Active immersion</em> requires full attention to the content
and can be practiced through reading and watching content in the target language.
<em>Passive immersion</em> means listening to the language while in idle activities.
When listening passively you're not fully focused on the content,
instead you're doing something else
while having the speech in your target language play in the background.</p>
<p>We do passive immersion during times in a day where we can't actively engage with the language,
such as when cooking, cleaning or commuting.
Although your attention is divided during passive immersion,
because you're left with no other choice,
it is still better compared to no immersion at all.</p>
<p>As noted in the introduction article, there are countless opportunities
to do passive listening throughout the day.
Make passive listening a habit.
Every moment of your life has to be spent interacting with Japanese.</p>
<p>In the beginning passive immersion doesn't contribute much to comprehension gains,
instead it helps start distinguishing sounds and phonemes of your target language.
Focus your attention on hearing the sounds.
Maybe at first you won't even be able to hear where one word ends and another one starts,
but expect passive listening to boost your phonetic awareness within the first months,
given that you combine it with active immersion.</p>
<p>Passive listening is one of the key components of the AJATT method,
so it is important to make it as convenient as possible.
If preparing immersion content is tedious, you are not going to do it.</p>

<!-- bashblog_timestamp: #1617260890# -->
<div class="subtitle">April 01, 2021 &mdash; Tatsumoto</div>
<!-- text begin -->
<p>When we read manga,
sometimes there's a need to quickly OCR a portion of the screen
to look up new words and add sentences to Anki.
To do so, you're going to use an optical character recognition program and a few helper tools.</p>

<h1><a class="ablack" href="writing-japanese.html">Writing Japanese</a></h1>
<!-- bashblog_timestamp: #1615918788# -->
<div class="subtitle">March 16, 2021 &mdash; Tatsumoto</div>
<!-- text begin -->
<p>After you've got a few thousand hours of input
and can read content made for natives relatively effortlessly
it makes sense to start practicing writing Japanese by hand.
Bear in mind that being able to do so is not necessary unless you plan to live in Japan.
Nowadays writing is done on a keyboard
and doesn't require recalling characters from memory.
However, writing practice has the potential to improve your overall reading ability.</p>

<p>The

is great. One thing it is bad at, however,
is telling up to date information about technology and tools one may use.
I've got you covered on the
<a href="our-immersion-learning-toolset.html">tools</a>, <strong>and more</strong>.</p>
<p>Below is a quick rundown of a typical Japanese learning journey
that should get you to basic fluency in less than two years.</p>
