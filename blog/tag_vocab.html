<p><strong>Ajatt-Tools Kanji Transition deck</strong>
is an Anki Deck for newcomers to Japanese based on the JP1K method.
If you want to learn the theory behind this deck, please read
<a href="learning-kanji.html">this article</a>.</p>
<p>The deck is designed to teach how to recognize Kanji
along with the most common 1000 words used in everyday conversations.
Prior knowledge of <a href="learning-kana-in-two-days.html">kana</a> is required
but there is no need to do any isolated kanji study.</p>
<p>If you have already gone through RTK and know more than 1000 words,
you are unlikely to benefit from the deck.
However, if your vocabulary is below 1000 words,
I recommend that you give the Kanji Transition deck a try over studying kanji in isolation
and premade decks like Core or Tango.</p>
<p>The vocabulary used in the deck was taken from <a href="basic-vocabulary.html">Ankidrone Starter Pack</a>
and consists of words commonly used in everyday life in Japan.
Cards are presented relatively in the <code>1T</code> (<code>i+1</code>) order.
Each word along with each sentence has native audio and an English translation.</p>
<p>We have prepared two versions of the deck.
One for people who prefer
<a href="discussing-various-card-templates.html#targeted-sentence-cards-or-mpvacious-cards">TSC</a>
card format and another for people who like
<a href="discussing-various-card-templates.html#word-context-cards">WCC</a>
more.</p>

<p>After finishing kanji, kana and essential grammar
the bulk of your AJATT journey will consist of learning vocabulary.
As the first step in this process,
it makes sense to go through a basic vocabulary deck
containing the most frequent words in Japanese.
As before, you are going to use <a href="setting-up-anki.html">Anki</a> to do it.</p>
<p>Before diving in to full-fledged immersion learning,
memorizing the most frequently used 1 or 2 thousand words
is a great way to jumpstart your comprehension.
After that learning vocabulary from immersion becomes easier
because you'll at least be able to recognize the majority of words in a given sentence.
You will still have to look up many words per page,
but the process is going to take less effort.</p>
