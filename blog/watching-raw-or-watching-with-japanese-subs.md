Both have their advantages.
When you watch with Japanese subs, you train your reading comprehension.
When you watch raw, you train your listening comprehension.
Try to balance the two.

No matter what you choose, it is important that you watch raw at least some of the time.
If you always watch with subs, your listening ability won't be improving.

I like the idea of watching raw
and only turning the subs on when you don't understand something.
