On my desktop and laptop,
I use the [GNU operating system](https://www.gnu.org/)
with [linux-hardened](https://github.com/anthraxx/linux-hardened).
And the distribution of GNU that I use is [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/).

On mobile,
I use [LineageOS](https://lineageos.org/) without Google Apps
and install applications from [NeoStore](https://github.com/NeoApplications/Neo-Store)
or from [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/).
