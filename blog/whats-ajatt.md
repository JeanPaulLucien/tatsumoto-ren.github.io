AJATT stands for **All Japanese All The Time**.
It's a method of reaching fluency in Japanese in a relatively short period of time.
The AJATT site was created by Khatzumoto in `2006`.
On the site Khatzumoto teaches the method he used to become fluent in Japanese.

The AJATT Method encourages doing as much Japanese as you can every day.
Khatzumoto said that fun and learning are a great combination.
He advised that Japanese should not be turned into "work" or "study",
that enjoying the process is absolutely essential.
If the process is not fun, one should stop now or figure a way to make it fun.

Central aspects of the method include
James Heisig's Remembering the Kanji,
Stephen Krashen's Input Hypothesis,
using the SRS,
learning sentences instead of vocabulary and grammar.

AJATT was influenced by Antimoon,
another input-based language learning method.
While Antimoon focuses on learning English,
AJATT revolves around Japanese, and to a lesser extent, Chinese.
Later on AJATT influenced many other language learning methods.

This site is heavily inspired by AJATT.
Although there are areas in which I disagree with AJATT,
the core ideas are the same.
My goal is to bring AJATT's insights to a larger audience
and update the method by introducing new tools and ideas.

AJATT can also be applicable for learning any language
if Japanese-specific parts are replaced.
