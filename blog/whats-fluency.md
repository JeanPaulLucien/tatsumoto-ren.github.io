Fluency is when you understand at least `98%` of your immersion.

For example, a typical episode of anime contains 300-400 lines of dialogue.
If you watch the episode and encounter only 7-8 or less unknown words,
you can call yourself fluent.

Your level of comprehension depends on the [domain](how-broad-or-narrow-is-a-domain-of-language.html) of interest.
If you are not a mathematician, watching a lecture on mathematics
may result in a lower percentage of understanding of the material,
until you learn what you don't know.
But, if you have a near-perfect comprehension of everyday speech, anime and dramas, comic books,
then that is considered fluent.

In other words,
fluency means being comfortable living your life completely immersed in another language.
