Fluency is when you understand at least `98%` of your immersion.

For example, a typical episode of anime contains 300-400 lines of dialogue.
If you watch the episode and encounter only 7-8 or less unknown words,
you can call yourself fluent.

In other words,
fluency means being comfortable living your life completely immersed in another language.
