You always make a card.

If you create a card, it doesn't mean you have to learn it.
I have [new cards per day set to 0](setting-up-anki.html#new-cards-day)
and learn the cards I select manually from my sentence bank.

Whether to learn the mined card depends on your current level.
Beginners should focus on learning common words.
There are various tips to achieve that.

* Using [frequency lists](yomichan-and-epwing-dictionaries.html#frequency-lists).
* Mining only the words that you have encountered at least once before but haven't memorized.
  When you see an unknown word,
  check if you already have it in your Anki deck but haven't learned it.

As you progress, these tips help less and less.

* Frequency lists become inaccurate very fast.
  You need more specific lists.

  After just the first ~1000 words on a list,
  the frequency of the words
  begins to significantly vary
  depending on the specific sources from which the list was created.
  If a word has high frequency according to a list,
  you might still rarely see it in your immersion.
* Words you learn are not common anymore, and it takes a long time to encounter each word twice.

If you're feeling lazy then just don't mine,
as long as it's not your permanent state.
Immersion learning is not math,
you're not going to get a bad grade if you don't learn something.
If the word is important, it will come up again.
