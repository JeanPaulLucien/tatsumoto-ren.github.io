Reading [leads to sub-vocalizing](early-output-or-reading-ahead-of-listening.html)
which forms bad pronunciation habits
and negatively influences the way you perceive spoken language.
In the beginning I recommend putting more time into listening than reading.
Passive listening also adds up to the total hours.

If the text is voiced,
such as anime with subtitles,
it counts towards reading practice
unless you don't read along.

Reading may be a challenge at first,
but getting good at reading is not that hard,
and it's never late to start reading.
Getting perfect at listening and speaking is much harder.
If your reading gets too good
and your listening lags too far behind,
your brain will start to become too reading-dominant,
and this is very hard to reverse later.
It cripples you almost permanently.
